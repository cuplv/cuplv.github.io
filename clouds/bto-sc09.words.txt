Automating the Generation of Composed Linear Algebra Kernels
	Memory bandwidth limits the performance of important
	kernels in many scientific applications. Such applications
	often use sequences of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
	(BLAS), and highly efficient implementations of those routines
	enable scientists to achieve high performance at little
	cost. However, tuning the BLAS in isolation misses
	opportunities for memory optimization that result from
	composing multiple subprograms. Because it is not practical to
	create a library of all BLAS combinations, we have developed a
	domain-specific compiler that generates them on demand. In
	this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for compiling linear
	algebra kernels and searching for the best combination of
	optimization choices. We also present a new hybrid
	analytic/empirical method for quickly evaluating the
	profitability of each optimization. We report experimental
	results showing speedups of up to 130% relative to the
	GotoBLAS on an AMD Opteron and up to 137% relative to MKL on
	an Intel Core 2.
