Abstract Domains and Solvers for Sets Reasoning
				When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to
				reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.
				Symbolic set abstractions provide building blocks that can be used to
				partition elements, relate partitions to other partitions, and determine
				the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing any concrete
				values. To address the simultaneous challenges of scalability and
				precision, we formalize and implement an interface for symbolic set
				abstractions and construct multiple abstract domains relying on both
				specialized data structures and off-the-shelf theorem provers. We
				develop techniques for lifting existing domains to improve performance
				and precision. We evaluate these domains on real-world data structure
				analysis problems.
