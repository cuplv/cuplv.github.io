Abstract Domains and Solvers for Sets Reasoning
        When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to
        reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.
        Symbolic set abstractions provide building blocks that can be used to
        partition elements, relate partitions to other partitions, and determine
        the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing any concrete
        values. To address the simultaneous challenges of scalability and
        precision, we formalize and implement an interface for symbolic set
        abstractions and construct multiple abstract domains relying on both
        specialized data structures and off-the-shelf theorem provers. We
        develop techniques for lifting existing domains to improve performance
        and precision. We evaluate these domains on real-world data structure
        analysis problems.
