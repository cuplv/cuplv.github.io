Access Nets: Modeling Access to Physical Spaces
  Electronic, software-managed mechanisms using, for example,
  radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards, enable great
  flexibility in specifying access control policies to physical
  spaces.  For example, access rights may vary based on time of
  day or could differ in normal versus emergency situations.
  With such fine-grained control, understanding and reasoning
  about what a policy permits becomes surprisingly difficult
  requiring knowledge of permission levels, spatial layout, and
  time.  In this paper, we present a formal modeling framework,
  called Access Nets, suitable for describing a
  combination of access permissions, physical spaces, and
  temporal constraints.  Furthermore, we provide evidence that
  model checking techniques are effective in reasoning about
  physical access control policies.  We describe our results
  from a tool that uses reachability analysis to validate
  security policies.
