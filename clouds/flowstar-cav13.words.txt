Flow*: An Analyzer for Non-Linear Hybrid Systems
  The tool Flow* performs Taylor model-based flowpipe construction for
  non-linear (polynomial) hybrid systems. Flow* combines well-known Taylor
  model arithmetic techniques for guaranteed approximations of the
  continuous dynamics in each mode with a combination of approaches for
  handling mode invariants and discrete transitions. Flow* supports a wide
  variety of optimizations including adaptive step sizes, adaptive
  selection of approximation orders and the heuristic selection of
  template directions for aggregating flowpipes. This paper describes
  Flow* and demonstrates its performance on a series of non-linear
  continuous and hybrid system benchmarks. Our comparisons show that Flow*
  is competitive with other tool
