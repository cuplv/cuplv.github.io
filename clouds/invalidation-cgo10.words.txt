An Efficient Software Transactional Memory Using Commit-Time Invalidation
	To improve the performance of transactional memory (TM),
	researchers have found many eager and lazy optimizations for
	conflict detection, the process of determining if transactions
	can commit. Despite these optimizations, nearly all TMs
	perform one aspect of lazy conflict detection in the same
	manner to preserve serializability. That is, they perform
	commit-time validation, where a transaction is checked for
	conflicts with previously committed transactions during its
	commit phase. While commit-time validation is efficient for
	workloads that exhibit limited contention, it can limit
	transaction throughput for contending workloads.

        This paper presents an efficient implementation of commit-time
        invalidation, a strategy where transactions resolve their
        conflicts with in-flight (uncommitted) transactions before
        they commit. Commit-time invalidation supplies the contention
        manager (CM) with data that is unavailable through commit-time
        validation, allowing the CM to make decisions that increase
        transaction throughput. Commit-time invalidation also requires
        notably fewer operations than commit-time validation for
        memory-intensive transactions, uses zero commit-time
        operations for dynamically detected read-only transactions,
        and guarantees full opacity for any transaction in O(N) time,
        an improvement over incremental validation's O(N2) time. Our
        experimental results show that for contending workloads, our
        efficient commit-time invalidating software TM (STM) is up to
        3 x faster than TL2, a state-of-the-art validating STM.
