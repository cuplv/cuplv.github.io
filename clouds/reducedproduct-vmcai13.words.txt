Reduced Product Combination of Abstract Domains for Shapes
	Real-world data structures are often enhanced with additional
	pointers capturing alternative paths through a basic inductive skeleton
				(e.g., back pointers, head pointers). From the static analysis point of view,
	we must obtain several interlocking shape invariants. At the same time, it is
	well understood in abstract interpretation design that supporting a separation
	of concerns is critically important to designing powerful static analyses.
	Such a separation of concerns is often obtained via a reduced product on a
	case-by-case basis. In this paper, we lift this idea to abstract domains for
	shape analyses, introducing a domain combination operator for memory
	abstractions. As an example, we present simultaneous separating shape
	graphs, a product construction that combines instances of
	separation logic-based shape domains. The key enabler for this
	construction is a static analysis on inductive data structure
	definitions to derive relations between the skeleton and the alternative
	paths. From the engineering standpoint, this construction allows each
	component to reason independently about different aspects of the data
	structure invariant and then separately exchange information via a
	reduction operator. From the usability standpoint, we enable describing
	a data structure invariant in terms of several inductive definitions
	that hold simultaneously.
