 Generalizing the Template Polyhedral Domain 
  Template polyhedra generalize weakly relational domains by
  specifying arbitrary fixed linear expressions on the left-hand sides
  of inequalities and undetermined constants on the right. The domain
  operations required for analysis over template polyhedra can be
  computed in polynomial time using linear programming.  In this
  paper, we introduce the generalized template polyhedral domain that
  extends template polyhedra using fixed left-hand side expressions
  with bilinear forms involving program variables and unknown
  parameters to the right. We prove that the domain operations over
  generalized templates can be defined as the ``best possible
  abstractions'' of the corresponding polyhedral domain
  operations. The resulting analysis can straddle the entire space of
  linear relation analysis starting from the template domain to the
  full polyhedral domain.




  We show that analysis in the generalized template domain can be
  performed by dualizing the join, post-condition and widening
  operations.  We also investigate the special case of template
  polyhedra wherein each bilinear form has at most two parameters. For
  this domain, we use the special properties of two dimensional
  polyhedra and techniques from fractional linear programming to
  derive domain operations that can be implemented in polynomial time
  over the number of variables in the program and the size of the
  polyhedra. We present applications of generalized template polyhedra
  to strengthen previously obtained invariants by converting them into
  templates.  We describe an experimental evaluation of an
  implementation over several benchmark systems.
