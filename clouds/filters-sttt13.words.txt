A Bit Too Precise? Verification of Quantized Digital Filters
  Fixed point digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a
  wide variety of digital processing and control systems. Common errors
        in fixed point filters include arithmetic round-off (truncation) errors,
  overflows and the presence of limit cycles. These errors can potentially
  compromise the correctness of the system as a whole. Traditionally digital
  filters have been verified using a combination of design techniques from control
  theory and extensive testing. In this paper, we examine the use of formal
  verification techniques as part of the design flow for fixed point digital
  filters. We study two classes of verification techniques involving bit-precise
  analysis and real-valued error approximations, respectively. We empirically
  evaluate several variants of these two fundamental approaches for verifying
  fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We design our comparison to
  reveal the best possible approach towards verifying real-world designs of
  infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. Our study compares the
  strengths and weaknesses of different verification techniques for digital
  filters and suggests efficient approaches using modern
  satisfiability-modulo-theories solvers (SMT) and hardware model checkers. This
  manuscript extends our previous work evaluating bounded verification, where a
  limited number of iterations of the system are explored, with unbounded
  verification, where an unlimited number of iterations of the system are
  considered. Doing so allows us to evaluate techniques that can prove the
  correctness of fixed point digital filter implementations.
