S-Taliro: A Tool for Temporal Logic Falsification for Hybrid Systems
S-TaLiRo is a Matlab (TM) toolbox that searches for trajectories of
minimal robustness in Simulink/Stateflow diagrams. It can analyze
arbitrary Simulink models or user defined functions that model the
system. At the heart of the tool, we use randomized testing based on
stochastic optimization techniques including Monte-Carlo methods and
Ant-Colony Optimization. Among the advantages of the toolbox is the
seamless integration inside the Matlab environment, which is widely
used in the industry for model-based development of control
software. We present the architecture of S-TaLiRo and its working on
an application example.
