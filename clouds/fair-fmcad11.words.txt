An Incremental Approach to Model Checking Progress Properties
	An incremental algorithm for model checking progress
	properties is proposed. It follows from the following insight:
	any SCC-closed region of a system’s state graph can be
	represented by a sequence of inductive assertions. Each
	iteration of the algorithm selects a set of states, called a
	skeleton, that together satisfy all fairness conditions; it
	then applies safety model checkers to attempt to connect the
	states into a reachable fair cycle. If this attempt fails, the
	resulting learned lemma takes one of two forms: an inductive
	reachability assertion that shows that at least one state of
	the skeleton is unreachable, or an inductive wall that deﬁnes
	two SCC-closed regions of the state graph. Subsequent
	skeletons must be chosen entirely from one side of the
	wall. Because a lemma often applies more generally than to the
	one skeleton from which it was derived, property-directed
	abstraction is achieved. The algorithm is highly
	parallelizable.
