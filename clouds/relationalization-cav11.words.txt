Relational Abstractions for Continuous and Hybrid Systems 
   In this paper, we define relational abstractions of hybrid systems.
  A relational abstraction is obtained by replacing the continuous
  dynamics in each mode by a binary transition relation that relates a
  state of the system to any state that can potentially be reached at
  some future time instant using the continuous dynamics.  We
  construct relational abstractions by reusing template-based
  invariant generation techniques for continuous systems described by
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).  As a result, we abstract a
  given hybrid system as a purely discrete, infinite-state system.  We
  apply k-induction to this abstraction to prove safety properties,
  and use bounded model-checking to find potential falsifications.  We
  present the basic underpinnings of our approach and demonstrate its
  use on many benchmark systems to derive simple and usable
  abstractions.
