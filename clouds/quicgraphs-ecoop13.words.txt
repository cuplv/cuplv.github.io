QUIC Graphs: Relational Invariant Generation for Containers
	Programs written in modern languages perform intricate
	manipulations of containers such as arrays, lists, dictionaries,
	and sets. We present an abstract interpretation-based framework
	for automatically inferring relations between the set of values
	stored in these containers. Relations include inclusion relations over
	unions and intersections, as well as quantified relationships with
	scalar variables. We develop an abstract domain constructor that builds
	a container domain out of a
	Quantified Union-Intersection Constraint (QUIC) graph
	parameterized by an arbitrary base domain.  We instantiate
	our domain with a polyhedral base domain and evaluate it on
	programs extracted from the Python test suite.  Over traditional,
	non-relational domains, we find significant precision improvements
	with minimal performance cost.
