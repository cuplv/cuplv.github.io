 Automatic Abstraction of Non-Linear Systems Using Change of Variables Transformations 
       We present abstraction techniques that transform a given non-linear
  dynamical system into a linear system, such that, invariant
  properties of the resulting linear abstraction can be used to infer
  invariants for the original system. The abstraction techniques rely
  on a change of bases transformation that associates each state
  variable of the abstract system with a function involving the state
  variables of the original system. We present conditions under which
  a given change of basis transformation for a non-linear system can
  define an abstraction. 



  Furthermore, we present a technique to discover, given a non-linear
  system, if a change of bases transformation involving degree-bounded
  polynomials yielding a linear system abstraction exists. If so, our
  technique yields the resulting abstract linear system, as well. This
  approach is further extended to search for a change of bases
  transformation that abstracts a given non-linear system into a
  system of linear differential inclusions.  Our techniques enable the
  use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer invariants
  for non-linear systems. We present preliminary evidence of the
  practical feasibility of our ideas using a prototype implementation.
