Invariant Generation for Parametrized Systems using Self-Reflection
				We examine the problem of inferring invariants for
				parametrized systems. Parametrized systems are concurrent
				systems consisting of an a priori unbounded number of process
				instances running the same program. Such systems are commonly
				encountered in many situations including device drivers,
				distributed systems, and robotic swarms. In this paper we
				describe a technique that enables leveraging off-the-shelf
				invariant generators designed for sequential programs to infer
				invariants of parametrized systems. The central challenge in
				invariant inference for parametrized systems is that näıvely
				exploding the transition system with all interleavings is not
				just impractical but impossible. In our approach, the key
				enabler is the notion of a reﬂective abstraction that we prove
				has an important correspondence with inductive
				invariants. This correspondence naturally gives rise to an
				iterative invariant generation procedure that alternates
				between computing candidate invariants and creating reﬂective
				abstractions.
