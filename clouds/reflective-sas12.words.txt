Invariant Generation for Parametrized Systems using Self-Reflection
        We examine the problem of inferring invariants for
        parametrized systems. Parametrized systems are concurrent
        systems consisting of an a priori unbounded number of process
        instances running the same program. Such systems are commonly
        encountered in many situations including device drivers,
        distributed systems, and robotic swarms. In this paper we
        describe a technique that enables leveraging off-the-shelf
        invariant generators designed for sequential programs to infer
        invariants of parametrized systems. The central challenge in
        invariant inference for parametrized systems is that näıvely
        exploding the transition system with all interleavings is not
        just impractical but impossible. In our approach, the key
        enabler is the notion of a reﬂective abstraction that we prove
        has an important correspondence with inductive
        invariants. This correspondence naturally gives rise to an
        iterative invariant generation procedure that alternates
        between computing candidate invariants and creating reﬂective
        abstractions.
