Probabilistic Program Analysis with Martingales
  We present techniques for the analysis of infinite state
  probabilistic programs to synthesize probabilistic invariants and prove
  almost-sure termination. Our analysis is based on the notion of (super)
  martingales from probability theory. First, we define the concept of
  (super) martingales for loops in probabilistic programs. Next, we
  present the use of concentration of measure inequalities to bound the
  values of martingales with high probability. This directly allows us to
  infer probabilistic bounds on assertions involving the program
  variables. Next, we present the notion of a super martingale ranking
  function (SMRF) to prove almost sure termination of probabilistic
  programs. Finally, we extend constraint-based techniques to synthesize
  martingales and super-martingale ranking functions for probabilistic
  programs. We present some applications of our approach to reason about
  invariance and termination of small but complex probabilistic programs.
