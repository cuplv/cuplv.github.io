Desynchronized Multi-State Abstractions for Open Programs in Dynamic Languages
	Dynamic language library developers face a challenging problem:
	ensuring that their libraries will behave correctly for a wide variety
	of client programs without having access to those client programs. This
	problem stems from the common use of two defining features for dynamic
	languages: callbacks into client code and complex manipulation of
	attribute names within objects. To remedy this problem, we introduce two
	state-spanning abstractions. To analyze callbacks, the first abstraction
	desynchronizes a heap, allowing partitions of the heap that may be
	affected by a callback to an unknown function to be frozen in the state
	prior to the call. To analyze object attribute manipulation, building
	upon an abstraction for dynamic language heaps, the second abstraction
	tracks attribute name/value pairs across the execution of a library. We
	implement these abstractions and use them to verify modular
	specifications of class-, trait-, and mixin-implementing libraries.
