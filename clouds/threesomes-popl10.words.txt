Threesomes, With and Without Blame
	The blame calculus of Wadler and Findler gives a high-level
	semantics to casts in higher-order languages. The coercion
	calculus of Henglein, on the other hand, provides an
	instruction set for casts whose normal forms ensure space
	efficiency. In this paper we address two questions: 1) can
	space efficiency be obtained in a high-level semantics? and 2)
	can we precisely characterize the relationship between the
	high and low-level semantics of casts? Towards answering both
	of these questions, we design a cast calculus that summarizes
	a sequence of casts as a threesome cast that contains a source
	type, a target type, and a third middle type that is the
	greatest lower bound of all the types in the sequence. We show
	that the threesome calculus is equivalent to the blame
	calculus and to one of the coercion-based, blame-tracking
	calculi of Siek, Garcia, and Taha. We also show that the
	threesome calculus is space efficient and obtain a tighter
	bound than that of Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan.
