A Bit Too Precise? Bounded Verification of Quantized Digital Filters
	Digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a wide
	variety of digital processing and control systems. Errors in
	the filters can be catastrophic.  Traditionally digital
	filters have been verified using methods from control theory
	and extensive testing.  We study two alternative verification
	techniques: bit-precise analysis and real-valued error
	approximations.  In this paper, we empirically evaluate
	several variants of these two fundamental approaches for
	verifying fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We
	design our comparison to reveal the best possible approach
	towards verifying real-world designs of infinite impulse
	response (IIR) digital filters. Our study reveals broader
	insights into cases where bit-reasoning is absolutely
	necessary and suggests efficient approaches using modern
	satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers.
