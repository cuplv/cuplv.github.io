Incremental Inductive CTL Model Checking
        A SAT-based incremental, inductive algorithm for model
        checking CTL properties is proposed. As in classic CTL model
        checking, the parse graph of the property shapes the
        analysis. However, in the proposed algorithm, called IICTL,
        the analysis is directed by task states that are pushed down
        the parse tree. To each node is associated over- and
        under-approximations to the set of states satisfying that
        nodeâ€™s property; these approximations are refined until a
        proof that the property does or does not hold is
        obtained. Each CTL operator corresponds naturally to an
        incremental sub-query: given a task state, an EX node executes
        a SAT query; an EU node applies IC3; and an EG node applies
        FAIR. In each case, the query result provides more general
        information than necessary to satisfy the task. When a query
        is satisfiable, the returned trace is generalized using
        forall-exists reasoning, during which IC3 is applied to obtain
        new reachability information that enables greater
        generalization. When a query is unsatisfiable, the proof
        provides the generalization. In this way, property-directed
        abstraction is achieved.
