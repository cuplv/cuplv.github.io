Shape Analysis for Unstructured Sharing
    Shape analysis aims to infer precise structural properties of
  imperative memory states and has been applied heavily to verify
  safety properties on imperative code over pointer-based data
  structures. Recent advances in shape analysis based on separation
  logic has leveraged summarization predicates that describe unbounded
  heap regions like lists or trees using inductive
  definitions. Unfortunately, data structures with unstructured
    sharing, such as graphs, are challenging to describe and reason
  about in such frameworks.
  In particular, when the sharing is unstructured, it cannot be described
  inductively in a local manner.
  In this paper, we propose a global
  abstraction of sharing based on set-valued variables that when
  integrated with inductive definitions enables the specification and
  shape analysis of structures with unstructured sharing.
