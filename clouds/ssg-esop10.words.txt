Separating Shape Graphs
	Detailed memory models that expose individual fields are
	necessary to precisely analyze code that makes use of
	low-level aspects such as, pointers to fields and untagged
	unions.  Yet, higher-level representations that collect fields
	into records are often used because they are typically more
	convenient and efficient in modeling the program heap.  In
	this paper, we present a shape graph representation of memory
	that exposes individual fields while largely retaining the
	convenience of an object-level model.  This representation has
	a close connection to particular kinds of formulas in
	separation logic.  Then, with this representation, we show how
	to extend the Xisa shape analyzer for
	low-level aspects, including pointers to fields, C-style
	nested structures and unions, malloc and free, and array
	values, with minimal changes to the core algorithms (e.g.,
	materialization and summarization).
