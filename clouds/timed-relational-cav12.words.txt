Timed Relational Abstractions of Sampled-Data Control Systems
        
          In this paper, we define timed relational abstractions for
          verifying sampled data control systems. Sampled data control
          systems consist of a plant, modeled as a hybrid system and a
          synchronous controller, modeled as a discrete transition
          system. The controller computes control inputs and/or sends
          control events to the plant based on the periodically
          sampled state of the plant. The correctness of the system
          depends on the controller design as well as an appropriate
          choice of the controller sampling period.
        


        
          Our approach constructs a timed relational abstraction of
          the hybrid plant by replacing the continuous plant dynamics
          by relations. These relations map a state of the plant to
          states reachable within the sampling time period. We present
          techniques for building timed relational abstractions, while
          taking care of discrete transitions that can be taken by the
          plant between samples. The resulting abstractions are better
          suited for the verification of sampled data control
          systems. The abstractions focus on the states that can be
          observed by the controller at the sample times, while
          abstracting away behaviors between sample times
          conservatively. The resulting abstractions are discrete,
          infinite-state transition systems. Thus conventional
          verification tools can be used to verify safety properties
          of these abstractions. We use k-induction to prove safety
          properties and bounded model checking (BMC) to find
          potential falsifications. We present our idea, its
          implementation and results on many benchmark examples.
