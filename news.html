                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Most software development today leverages the world's massive collection of open source software. There is significant room
                        for program analyses to similarly leverage Big Code, the collective knowledge amassed from analyzing existing programs, to
                        automatically infer or predict salient behaviors and vulnerabilities in new programs. We present Petablox, a framework for
                        automatically synthesizing use-cases of arbitrary declarative program analyses for Big Code tasks such as efficiently finding
                        good abstractions, transferring analysis results across programs, and adapting analyses to user feedback. Despite their diversity,
                        all these tasks entail solving large instances of MaxSAT, the maximum satisfiability problem which comprises a mix of hard
                        (inviolable, logical) constraints and soft (violable, probabilistic) constraints. We describe demand-driven, compositional,
                        and learning-based MaxSAT optimizations in Petablox for scaling these tasks to large code bases.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Static program analysis is a powerful technique for bug-finding, verification, and program understanding. Yet static analyses
                        remain conspicuously absent from the toolbox of the average developer because they must abstract away details about concrete
                        program behavior. Designing effective abstractions is tricky business: imprecise abstractions are inexpensive, but can be
                        useless because they lose too much information about the program, whereas conventional wisdom states that precise abstractions
                        are too expensive to scale.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This dissertation considers the problem of goal-directed static analysis, an intriguing domain where there is hope for defying
                        the conventional wisdom about precise and scalable abstractions. In contrast to more traditional whole-program approaches
                        that must apply precise abstractions to the entire program, goal-directed approaches have the potential to be much more tractable

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">There are two fundamental challenges in goal-directed analysis: (A) designing abstractions that are as flexible as possible
                        so they can be specialized to the needs of the query and (B) using this flexibility wisely to achieve a better precision/scalability
                        tradeoff in practice. This dissertation addresses these challenges by introducing goal-directed abstraction coarsening, a
                        new approach to goal-directed analysis. Our approach works backward from the goal query using an abstraction that is as precise
                        as possible by default, but can be coarsened in order to narrow the focus of the analysis and improve scalability. We meet
                        Challenge A by introducing flexible coarsening-based techniques for store abstraction and control-flow abstraction. Our store
                        abstraction precisely represents a small view of the store relevant to the query by combining a separation logic-based representation
                        with a flow-insensitive points-to analysis. We present a general framework for flexible control-flow abstraction that allows
                        the framework to coarsen the control-flow abstraction by jumping over irrelevant code. Finally, we meet Challenge B by presenting
                        goal-directed analyses incorporating our flexible abstractions. Our analyses use programmers’ invariant-based reasoning and
                        the structure of event-driven programs to recognize opportunities for coarsening that are likely to enhance scalability without
                        losing precision. We have implemented these analyses and shown that they can achieve precise and scalable results for a variety
                        of client analyses than cannot be handled effectively by previous techniques.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Hybrid automata are a natural and expressive formalism to model systems that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior.
                        However, the applications of hybrid automata in analyzing cyber-physical systems have been rather limited due to undecidability
                        of simple verification problems such as reachability. This drawback of hybrid automata has fueled the investigation of the
                        so-called compositional methodology to design complex system by sequentially composing well-understood lower-level components.
                        This methodology has, for example, been used in the context of the motion planning problem for mobile robots, where the task
                        is to move a robot along a pre-specified trajectory with arbitrary precision by sequentially composing a set of well-studied
                        simple motion primitives, such as “move left”, “move right” and “go straight”.  In this talk, we summarize some of our recent
                        results related to efficient solution of motion planning problem for systems whose motion primitives are given as constant-rate
                        vectors with uncertainties.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Automatic device driver synthesis is a radical approach to
                        creating drivers faster and with fewer defects by generating them
                        automatically based on hardware device specifications. I will present
                        the design and implementation of a new driver synthesis toolkit, called
                        Termite. Termite is the first tool to combine the power of automation
                        with the flexibility of conventional development. It is also the first
                        practical synthesis tool based on abstraction refinement. Finally, it is
                        the first synthesis tool to support automated debugging of input
                        specifications. I will explain the main principles behind the tool and
                        give a brief demo of its capabilities.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">JavaScript programs tend to suffer from memory issues that can either hurt performance, or worse, make programs crash due
                        to slow exhaustion of memory. We present a new memory profiling tool MemInsight for JavaScript applications, including web
                        applications. MemInsight is platform independent: it employs source-code instrumentation to generate a trace of memory allocations
                        and accesses, and it uses standard browser features to track precise information for DOM (document object model) objects.
                        The information thus collected enables detailed, time-varying analysis of memory behavior, including that of DOM objects.
                        	  
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">We describe several client analyses built into MemInsight. For instance, it points out situations in which there may be a
                        memory leak, and it reports opportunities for replacing dynamic allocation with stack allocation. MemInsight is extensible
                        to custom analyses as well. Our experimental evaluation showed that our client analyses found interesting memory issues in
                        several publicly available apps, and that MemInsight had reasonable overhead.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Two-player games are a useful formalism for the synthesis of reactive
                        systems. The traditional approach to solving such games iteratively
                        computes the set of winning states for one of the players. This requires
                        keeping track of all discovered winning states and can lead to space
                        explosion even when using efficient symbolic representations.  I will
                        present a new game solving method that works by exploring a subset of
                        all possible concrete runs of the game and proving that these runs can
                        be generalised into a winning strategy on behalf of one of the players.
                        We use counterexample-guided backtracking search, inspired by the RaReQs
                        QBF solver, to identify a subset of runs  that are sufficient to
                        consider to solve the game. Our search procedure performs learning from
                        both players' failures, gradually shrinking winning regions for both
                        players.  In addition, it allows extracting compact winning/spoiling
                        strategies using interpolation procedures.  We evaluate our algorithm on
                        several families of benchmarks derived from real-world device driver
                        synthesis problems.  Our approach outperforms  state-of-the-art BDD
                        solvers on some families of benchmarks. We  demonstrated that our
                        strategy extraction procedure is efficient and introduces low overhead
                        on top of the main solver.

                        	  Behavioral contracts are a widely used specification tool for software components, which enrich interface information with
                        logical assertions. The rigorous enforcement of contracts provides to programmers precise guarantees about a program's execution,
                        and offers useful feedback for debugging upon contract violations. However, almost all of research on contracts focuses on
                        contracts as a specification tool for partial correctness of programs and ignores another vital requirement of modern software;
                        security.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I will demonstrate how contracts can specify and enforce security policies. Specifically, I will focus on two
                        applications of contracts in capability-based security. First, I will describe Shill; a secure shell scripting language where
                        contracts specify and enforce
                        policies about which OS resources scripts intend to use and how they use them. This way, Shill's contracts help script authors
                        and users to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Second, I will present a contract system that complements the contract
                        system of Shill by
                        describing and enforcing declarative policies for the flow of capabilities between components. This manner, components can
                        specify not only what capabilities they require from their users, but also how they intend to share these capabilities with
                        other components.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The optimization of short sequences of loop-free fixed-point x86_64 code sequences is an important problem in high-performance
                        computing. Unfortunately, the competing constraints of transformation correctness and performance improvement often force
                        even special purpose compilers to produce sub-optimal code. We show that by encoding these constraints as terms in a cost
                        function, and using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to rapidly explore the space of all possible programs, we are able
                        to generate aggressively optimized versions of a given target program. Beginning from binaries compiled by gcc -O0, we are
                        able to produce provably correct code sequences that either match or outperform the code produced by gcc -O3, and in some
                        cases expert hand-written assembly.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Because most high-performance applications contain floating-point computations, we extend our technique to this domain and
                        show a novel approach to trading full floating-point precision for further increases in performance. We demonstrate the ability
                        to generate reduced precision implementations of Intel's handwritten C numerics library that are up to six times faster than
                        the original code, and achieve end-to-end speedups of over 30% on a direct numeric simulation and a ray tracer. Because optimizations
                        that contain floating-point computations are not amenable to formal verification using the state of the art, we present a
                        technique for characterizing maximum error and providing strong evidence for correctness.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">The success of high-performance computing has facilitated the rapid development of increasingly complex models of natural
                        and engineered systems by biologists, physicists, chemists, and even financial engineers. While the development of such models
                        requires considerable domain knowledge and arguably little knowledge of the science of computing itself, we survey a key problem
                        in computational modeling that cuts across boundaries of scientific disciplines and motivates the development of new massively
                        parallel high-performance algorithms: the validation and parameter discovery for stochastic computational models.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Twitter is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on
                        	  the internet, with over 140 million active users and serving
                        	  over 400 million Tweets per day. Historically, nearly all of
                        	  Twitter's traffic has been served by a monolithic
                        	  application written in Ruby on Rails, referred to internally
                        	  as "the monorail." Although Twitter has seen remarkable
                        	  growth in its six years of existence, scaling this
                        	  monolithic architecture has proved to be both error-prone
                        	  and expensive, not only in terms of computational
                        	  efficiency, but in terms of developer efficiency as well.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">More recently, Twitter has begun the process of replacing
                        	  the monorail with a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA),
                        	  where the services are JVM processes--mostly written in
                        	  Scala--that communicate with one-another asynchronously over
                        	  a network connection. Naively written, asynchronous code is
                        	  often both tedious to write and difficult to reason about;
                        	  at Twitter, the asynchronous code implementing Scala
                        	  services is both simple and beautiful, thanks in large part
                        	  to an internally-developed, open-source library called
                        	  Finagle.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I will attempt to explain how Finagle's
                        	  strong grounding in programming language theory has
                        	  facilitated this transition to an SOA, and how Scala's
                        	  advanced features allow for a library as expressive as
                        	  Finagle to have been written in the first place.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine discretely evolving
                        	  computational components with a continuously changing
                        	  physical world. Examples of CPS include safety-critical
                        	  systems that control airplanes, automobiles, power plants
                        	  and implantable medical devices. Assuring the safety of
                        	  these systems requires techniques that transcend the limited
                        	  coverage provided by testing/simulation. Even though
                        	  impressive progress has been achieved with symbolic formal
                        	  verification techniques for linear systems, the verification
                        	  of non-linear, industrial scale CPS designs remains a
                        	  distant goal.
                     </p> 
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I present a simple yet
                        	  effective approach to automatically searching for property
                        	  violations in non-linear systems.  Our approach defines the
                        	  notion of robustness metrics over traces that can be used to
                        	  measure distances between simulation traces and properties
                        	  expressed in temporal logics.  As a result, robustness
                        	  metrics can naturally quantify how "close" a particular
                        	  simulation of the system is to violating a property of
                        	  interest.  By treating robustness metrics as an objective
                        	  function to minimize over the simulation traces of the
                        	  system, we can use many off-the-shelf global optimization
                        	  techniques to effectively steer the simulations towards a
                        	  falsification of the property being considered.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Despite the lack of strong formal guarantees, we find
                        	  that robustness-guided falsification is a promising approach
                        	  to searching for property violations in complex systems.  We
                        	  present the S-Taliro tool, an implementation of our approach
                        	  to reason about properties of non-linear systems modeled as
                        	  Simulink/Stateflow diagrams.  We present two interesting
                        	  case studies using S-Taliro, including a risk analysis of

                        	  often used to model the dynamics of a bio-chemical
                        	  network. Such systems are difficult to analyze. To get
                        	  around this, we construct a discrete probabilistic
                        	  approximation of the ODE dynamics as a dynamic Bayesian

                        	  data base, we have used our technique in a combined

                        	  system under inflammation conditions.  Our results are very
                        	  encouraging in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we

                        	  Towards the Verification of Hybrid Data-Flow Languages
                        	</em></h4>

                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Hybrid systems are used to model embedded computing
                        	  systems interacting with their physical environment. There
                        	  is a conceptual mismatch between high-level hybrid system
                        	  languages, like Simulink, which are used for simulation, and
                        	  hybrid automata, the most suitable representation for safety
                        	  verification. Indeed, in simulation languages the
                        	  interaction between discrete and continuous execution steps
                        	  is specified using the concept of zero-crossings, whereas
                        	  hybrid automata exploit the notion of staying conditions.
                        	  In this talk we first briefly present Zelus, a synchronous
                        	  data-flow language extended with ordinary differential
                        	  equations.  Then we propose a sound translation from a
                        	  Zelus-like hybrid data-flow formalism to logico-numerical
                        	  hybrid automata discussing various zero-crossing semantics
                        	  and the extent to which the original semantics is preserved.
                        	  At last we sketch how existing continuous reachability
                        	  analysis methods can be applied to logico-numerical hybrid
                        	  automata.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Finding bugs is among the most challenging tasks in
                        	  software development.  For this reason, modern software
                        	  development methodologies encourage programmers to use
                        	  assertions throughout their code to express the assumptions
                        	  they are making.  At runtime, these assertions then detect
                        	  whenever the assumptions do not match the program; in other
                        	  words, they detect bugs early.  However, traditional
                        	  assertion mechanisms in mainstream languages such as C or
                        	  Java are limited in their expressivity.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This talk presents DeAL, a rich heap assertion language
                        	  for Java that extends over the expressive power of
                        	  traditional assertions.  DeAL introduces additional
                        	  primitives to reason over heap layout, allowing programmers
                        	  to assert global invariants, ownership, and other properties
                        	  that would be impossible to express in traditional
                        	  assertions.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">By design, all DeAL assertions require only a single heap
                        	  traversal and can execute as part of garbage collection.
                        	  Consequently, DeAL is not only expressive, but also ensures
                        	  a very low execution overhead.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Recent years have seen intensive interest among
                        	  Programming Language (PL) researchers in connecting PL and
                        	  Verification.  Static analyses which once were primarily
                        	  intended for enabling optimizations in compilers are now
                        	  used also for program verification and bug finding.  Type
                        	  systems, which had been used to detect (either statically or
                        	  dynamically) low-level bugs, are now pushed to express
                        	  stronger and stronger semantic properties of code.  Arguably
                        	  the most powerful such systems known are so-called dependent
                        	  type systems, which combine programming and theorem proving,
                        	  and use rich types to express general logical specifications
                        	  of programs.

                        	  concerning general recursion and also the treatment of

                        	  verified modern SAT solver called versat in Guru. Versat

                        	  of modern solvers like Minisat, but has been statically
                        	  verified to be sound: if versat reports "unsat", then the

                  <h4><em>Proving stabilisation of biological models</em></h4>
                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  I will describe an efficient procedure for proving
                     	  stabilisation of biological systems when modeled as
                     	  qualitative networks or genetic regulatory networks. For
                     	  scalability, we use modular proof techniques, where
                     	  state-space exploration is applied only locally to small
                     	  pieces of the system rather than the entire system as a
                     	  whole. Our procedure exploits the observation that, in
                     	  practice, the form of modular proofs can be restricted to a
                     	  very limited set.  Using our new procedure, we have solved a
                     	  number of challenging published examples, including: a 3-D
                     	  model of the mammalian epidermis; a model of metabolic
                     	  networks operating in type-2 diabetes; a model of fate
                     	  determination of vulval precursor cells in the C. elegans
                     	  worm; and a model of pair-rule regulation during
                     	  segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. Our results show many
                     	  orders of magnitude speedup in cases where previous
                     	  stabilization proving techniques were known to succeed, and
                     	  new results in cases where tools had previously failed.

                        	  harness the power of parallelism is predicated upon advances
                        	  in tools and algorithms for verifying concurrent
                        	  programs. Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to
                        	  verify, and a key reason for this is the behavioral
                        	  complexity resulting from the large number of interleavings
                        	  of concurrent threads.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I will introduce a symbolic predictive
                        	  analysis for runtime detection of concurrency errors, by

                        	  of a program. In this analysis, we first derive a symbolic
                        	  predictive model using the trace information collected at
                        	  run time as well as the program source code. What this model
                        	  captures are not just the given traces, but all possible
                        	  interleavings of events of these traces. Then we use

                        	  errors in any of these interleavings. This is done by
                        	  capturing these interleavings and the error conditions using
                        	  a set of first-order logic formulas, and then deciding the

                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  I will describe some new methods of proving temporal
                     	  properties of infinite-state programs.  Our approach takes
                     	  advantage of the fact that linear-temporal properties can
                     	  often be proved more efficiently using proof techniques
                     	  usually associated with the branching-time logic CTL.  The
                     	  caveat is that, in certain instances, nondeterminism in the
                     	  system's transition relation can cause CTL methods to report
                     	  counterexamples that are spurious in LTL. To address this
                     	  problem we describe an algorithm that, as it attempts to
                     	  apply CTL proof methods, finds and then removes problematic
                     	  nondeterminism via an analysis on the spurious
                     	  counterexamples. We must also develop CTL symbolic model
                     	  checking tools for infinite-state systems.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Most programs get used in just one direction, from input
                        	  to output. But sometimes, having computed an output, we need
                        	  to be able to update this output and then "calculate
                        	  backwards" to find a correspondingly updated input. The
                        	  problem of writing such bidirectional transformations --
                        	  often called lenses -- arises in applications across a

                        	  perspectives. Potential applications include synchronization
                        	  of replicated data, system configuration management tools
                        	  (such as RedHat's Augeas system), bidirectional
                        	  transformations between software models, and updatable
                        	  "security views."

                        	  exploring a linguistic approach to bidirectional
                        	  programming, designing domain-specific languages in which
                        	  every expression simultaneously describes both parts of a
                        	  lens. When read from left to right, an expression denotes an
                        	  ordinary function that maps inputs to outputs. When read
                        	  from right to left, it denotes an "update translator" that
                        	  takes an input together with an updated output and produces
                        	  a new input that reflects the update. These languages share
                        	  some common elements with modern functional languages -- in
                        	  particular, they come with very expressive type systems. In

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">We have designed, implemented, and applied bi-directional
                        	  languages in three quite different domains: a language for
                        	  bidirectional transformations on trees (such as XML
                        	  documents), based on a collection of primitive bidirectional
                        	  tree transformation operations and
                        	  "bidirectionality-preserving" combining forms; a language
                        	  for bidirectional views of relational data, using
                        	  bidirectionalized versions of the operators of relational
                        	  algebra as primitives; and, most recently, a language for
                        	  bidirectional string transformations, with primitives based
                        	  on standard notations for finite-state transduction and a
                        	  type system based on regular expressions. The string case is
                        	  especially interesting, both in its own right and because it
                        	  exposes a number of foundational issues common to all
                        	  bidirectional programming languages in a simple and familiar
                        	  setting. We are also exploring how lenses and their types

                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">When parallel programming started in the 70s and 80s, it
                        	  was mostly art: languages such as functional and logic
                        	  programming languages were designed and appreciated mainly
                        	  for their elegance and beauty. More recently, parallel
                        	  programming has become engineering: conventional languages
                        	  like FORTRAN and C++ have been extended with constructs such
                        	  as OpenMP, and we now spend our time benchmarking and
                        	  tweaking large programs nobody understands to obtain
                        	  performance improvements of 5-10%. In spite of all this
                        	  activity, we have few insights into how to write parallel
                        	  programs to exploit the performance potential of multicore
                        	  processors.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">To break this impasse, we need a science of parallel
                        	  programming. In this talk, I will introduce a concept called
                        	  "amorphous data-parallelism" that provides a simple, unified
                        	  picture of parallelism in a host of diverse applications
                        	  ranging from mesh generation/refinement/partitioning to SAT
                        	  solvers, maxflow algorithms, stencil computations, and
                        	  event-driven simulation. Then I will present a natural
                        	  classification that provides insight into the structure of
                        	  parallelism and locality in these algorithms and into
                        	  appropriate language and systems support for exploiting this
                        	  parallelism.

                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  Desktop software, in the form of web browsers, browser
                     	  features, and OS distributions, are a growing area of
                     	  engineering activity at Google. This talk will give an
                     	  overview of this work, looking in detail at Native Client as
                     	  an example project in the space. Native Client is an
                     	  open-source research technology for running x86 native code
                     	  in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the
                     	  browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people
                     	  expect from web apps. It supports performance-oriented
                     	  features generally absent from web application programming
                     	  environments, such as thread support, instruction set
                     	  extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and
                     	  hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open
                     	  architecture designed to leverage existing web standards,
                     	  and to encourage community review and third-party
                     	  tools. Overall, Google's desktop efforts seek to enable new
                     	  Web applications, improve end-user experience, and enable a
                     	  more flexible balance between client and server
                     	  computing. Google has open sourced many of our desktop
                     	  efforts, in part to encourage collaboration and independent
                     	  innovation.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Loops often dominate the execution time of
                        	  applications. Various transformation frameworks have been
                        	  developed to enable the automatic compile-time
                        	  transformation of loops. Many of the existing models fit
                        	  within the polyhedral framework and although they are quite
                        	  powerful, they are restricted to compile-time
                        	  transformations and loop bounds and memory accesses that are
