        <title>Compiler and Runtime Optimizations for GPU Memory Systems</title>
        <abstract>
          <p>In recent year, we have seen a rapid rise of massive parallelism in
          modern processors, exemplified by GPUs, APUs and MIC processors. The
          emergence of massive parallelism in a single node brings growing
          demands for efficient data accesses. Optimizing memory throughput is
          hence critical for tapping into the full potential of the many-core
          systems. In the first half of the talk, I will present some
          theoretical and empirical results on optimizing memory coalescing for
          GPUs. In the second half of the talk, I will present our framework to
          automatically place data on GPUs for performance and portability.</p>

          Beyond Requirements Falsification: Semi-Formal Methods and Tools for the Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems
        </title>
        <abstract>
          <p>Correct-by-design synthesis methods for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are still in their infancy for CPS with complex physical dynamics. For that reason, a combination of design theories for simpler systems and/or ad-hoc design approaches are
            utilized. Hence, numerous design and implementation errors are discovered while CPS are operational in the field. Such errors can have catastrophic effects to human life and to the economy. Over the last few years, requirements guided falsification
            methods have proven to be a practical approach to the verification problem of industrial size CPS. However, requirements falsification is just one component of the necessary tools for the development of safe and reliable CPS. In this talk, Fainekos
            will provide an overview of his team's research in providing support for all the stages of the development for CPS, from formal requirements elicitation and mining to system conformance to on-line monitoring. Most of their methods have been
            implemented in a Matlab (TM) toolbox called S-TaLiRo (System's TemporAl LogIc Robustness). Finally, in this talk, he will demonstrate that S-TaLiRo can provide answers to challenge problems from the automotive industry.</p>

	<title>Petablox: Declarative Program Analysis for Big Code</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Most software development today leverages the world's massive collection of open source software. There is significant room for program analyses to similarly leverage Big Code, the collective knowledge amassed from analyzing existing programs, to automatically infer or predict salient behaviors and vulnerabilities in new programs. We present Petablox, a framework for automatically synthesizing use-cases of arbitrary declarative program analyses for Big Code tasks such as efficiently finding good abstractions, transferring analysis results across programs, and adapting analyses to user feedback. Despite their diversity, all these tasks entail solving large instances of MaxSAT, the maximum satisfiability problem which comprises a mix of hard (inviolable, logical) constraints and soft (violable, probabilistic) constraints. We describe demand-driven, compositional, and learning-based MaxSAT optimizations in Petablox for scaling these tasks to large code bases.</p>

	<title>Flexible Goal-Directed Abstraction</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Static program analysis is a powerful technique for bug-finding, verification, and program understanding. Yet static analyses remain conspicuously absent from the toolbox of the average developer because they must abstract away details about concrete program behavior. Designing effective abstractions is tricky business: imprecise abstractions are inexpensive, but can be useless because they lose too much information about the program, whereas conventional wisdom states that precise abstractions are too expensive to scale.</p>
<p>This dissertation considers the problem of goal-directed static analysis, an intriguing domain where there is hope for defying the conventional wisdom about precise and scalable abstractions. In contrast to more traditional whole-program approaches that must apply precise abstractions to the entire program, goal-directed approaches have the potential to be much more tractable because they can focus the effort of the analysis on a single goal query.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental challenges in goal-directed analysis: (A) designing abstractions that are as flexible as possible so they can be specialized to the needs of the query and (B) using this flexibility wisely to achieve a better precision/scalability tradeoff in practice. This dissertation addresses these challenges by introducing goal-directed abstraction coarsening, a new approach to goal-directed analysis. Our approach works backward from the goal query using an abstraction that is as precise as possible by default, but can be coarsened in order to narrow the focus of the analysis and improve scalability. We meet Challenge A by introducing flexible coarsening-based techniques for store abstraction and control-flow abstraction. Our store abstraction precisely represents a small view of the store relevant to the query by combining a separation logic-based representation with a flow-insensitive points-to analysis. We present a general framework for flexible control-flow abstraction that allows the framework to coarsen the control-flow abstraction by jumping over irrelevant code. Finally, we meet Challenge B by presenting goal-directed analyses incorporating our flexible abstractions. Our analyses use programmers‚Äô invariant-based reasoning and the structure of event-driven programs to recognize opportunities for coarsening that are likely to enhance scalability without losing precision. We have implemented these analyses and shown that they can achieve precise and scalable results for a variety of client analyses than cannot be handled effectively by previous techniques.</p>

	<title>
	  Decidable Subclasses of Multi-Mode Systems (Schedulability, Reachability, and Related Problems)
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Hybrid automata are a natural and expressive formalism to model systems that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. However, the applications of hybrid automata in analyzing cyber-physical systems have been rather limited due to undecidability of simple verification problems such as reachability. This drawback of hybrid automata has fueled the investigation of the so-called compositional methodology to design complex system by sequentially composing well-understood lower-level components. This methodology has, for example, been used in the context of the motion planning problem for mobile robots, where the task is to move a robot along a pre-specified trajectory with arbitrary precision by sequentially composing a set of well-studied simple motion primitives, such as ‚Äúmove left‚Äù, ‚Äúmove right‚Äù and ‚Äúgo straight‚Äù.  In this talk, we summarize some of our recent results related to efficient solution of motion planning problem for systems whose motion primitives are given as constant-rate vectors with uncertainties.</p>

	<title>Automatic Device Driver Synthesis</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Automatic device driver synthesis is a radical approach to
creating drivers faster and with fewer defects by generating them
automatically based on hardware device specifications. I will present
the design and implementation of a new driver synthesis toolkit, called
Termite. Termite is the first tool to combine the power of automation
with the flexibility of conventional development. It is also the first
practical synthesis tool based on abstraction refinement. Finally, it is
the first synthesis tool to support automated debugging of input
specifications. I will explain the main principles behind the tool and
give a brief demo of its capabilities.

	<title>MemInsight: Platform-Independent Memory Profiling for JavaScript</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>JavaScript programs tend to suffer from memory issues that can either hurt performance, or worse, make programs crash due to slow exhaustion of memory. We present a new memory profiling tool MemInsight for JavaScript applications, including web applications. MemInsight is platform independent: it employs source-code instrumentation to generate a trace of memory allocations and accesses, and it uses standard browser features to track precise information for DOM (document object model) objects. The information thus collected enables detailed, time-varying analysis of memory behavior, including that of DOM objects.
	  </p>
	  <p>We describe several client analyses built into MemInsight. For instance, it points out situations in which there may be a memory leak, and it reports opportunities for replacing dynamic allocation with stack allocation. MemInsight is extensible to custom analyses as well. Our experimental evaluation showed that our client analyses found interesting memory issues in several publicly available apps, and that MemInsight had reasonable overhead.

	<title>SAT-based Techniques for Reactive Synthesis</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Two-player games are a useful formalism for the synthesis of reactive
systems. The traditional approach to solving such games iteratively
computes the set of winning states for one of the players. This requires
keeping track of all discovered winning states and can lead to space
explosion even when using efficient symbolic representations.  I will
present a new game solving method that works by exploring a subset of
all possible concrete runs of the game and proving that these runs can
be generalised into a winning strategy on behalf of one of the players.
We use counterexample-guided backtracking search, inspired by the RaReQs
QBF solver, to identify a subset of runs  that are sufficient to
consider to solve the game. Our search procedure performs learning from
both players' failures, gradually shrinking winning regions for both
players.  In addition, it allows extracting compact winning/spoiling
strategies using interpolation procedures.  We evaluate our algorithm on
several families of benchmarks derived from real-world device driver
synthesis problems.  Our approach outperforms  state-of-the-art BDD
solvers on some families of benchmarks. We  demonstrated that our
strategy extraction procedure is efficient and introduces low overhead
on top of the main solver.

	  Behavioral contracts and security
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>
	  Behavioral contracts are a widely used specification tool for software components, which enrich interface information with logical assertions. The rigorous enforcement of contracts provides to programmers precise guarantees about a program's execution, and offers useful feedback for debugging upon contract violations. However, almost all of research on contracts focuses on contracts as a specification tool for partial correctness of programs and ignores another vital requirement of modern software; security.
	  </p>
          <p>In this talk, I will demonstrate how contracts can specify and enforce security policies. Specifically, I will focus on two applications of contracts in capability-based security. First, I will describe Shill; a secure shell scripting language where contracts specify and enforce
policies about which OS resources scripts intend to use and how they use them. This way, Shill's contracts help script authors and users to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Second, I will present a contract system that complements the contract system of Shill by
describing and enforcing declarative policies for the flow of capabilities between components. This manner, components can specify not only what capabilities they require from their users, but also how they intend to share these capabilities with other components.

	  Stochastic Optimization of x86_64 Binaries
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>The optimization of short sequences of loop-free fixed-point x86_64 code sequences is an important problem in high-performance computing. Unfortunately, the competing constraints of transformation correctness and performance improvement often force even special purpose compilers to produce sub-optimal code. We show that by encoding these constraints as terms in a cost function, and using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to rapidly explore the space of all possible programs, we are able to generate aggressively optimized versions of a given target program. Beginning from binaries compiled by gcc -O0, we are able to produce provably correct code sequences that either match or outperform the code produced by gcc -O3, and in some cases expert hand-written assembly.</p>
          <p>Because most high-performance applications contain floating-point computations, we extend our technique to this domain and show a novel approach to trading full floating-point precision for further increases in performance. We demonstrate the ability to generate reduced precision implementations of Intel's handwritten C numerics library that are up to six times faster than the original code, and achieve end-to-end speedups of over 30% on a direct numeric simulation and a ray tracer. Because optimizations that contain floating-point computations are not amenable to formal verification using the state of the art, we present a technique for characterizing maximum error and providing strong evidence for correctness.</p>

	  Validation and Parameter Discovery for Stochastic Computational Models from Behavioral Specifications
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>The success of high-performance computing has facilitated the rapid development of increasingly complex models of natural and engineered systems by biologists, physicists, chemists, and even financial engineers. While the development of such models requires considerable domain knowledge and arguably little knowledge of the science of computing itself, we survey a key problem in computational modeling that cuts across boundaries of scientific disciplines and motivates the development of new massively parallel high-performance algorithms: the validation and parameter discovery for stochastic computational models.</p>

	  Getting Off the Monorail or: How Twitter Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Monads
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Twitter is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on
	  the internet, with over 140 million active users and serving
	  over 400 million Tweets per day. Historically, nearly all of
	  Twitter's traffic has been served by a monolithic
	  application written in Ruby on Rails, referred to internally
	  as "the monorail." Although Twitter has seen remarkable
	  growth in its six years of existence, scaling this
	  monolithic architecture has proved to be both error-prone
	  and expensive, not only in terms of computational
	  efficiency, but in terms of developer efficiency as well.</p>
	  <p>More recently, Twitter has begun the process of replacing
	  the monorail with a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA),
	  where the services are JVM processes--mostly written in
	  Scala--that communicate with one-another asynchronously over
	  a network connection. Naively written, asynchronous code is
	  often both tedious to write and difficult to reason about;
	  at Twitter, the asynchronous code implementing Scala
	  services is both simple and beautiful, thanks in large part
	  to an internally-developed, open-source library called
	  Finagle.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will attempt to explain how Finagle's
	  strong grounding in programming language theory has
	  facilitated this transition to an SOA, and how Scala's
	  advanced features allow for a library as expressive as
	  Finagle to have been written in the first place.</p>

	  Finding Falsifications in Complex Cyber-Physical Systems
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine discretely evolving
	  computational components with a continuously changing
	  physical world. Examples of CPS include safety-critical
	  systems that control airplanes, automobiles, power plants
	  and implantable medical devices. Assuring the safety of
	  these systems requires techniques that transcend the limited
	  coverage provided by testing/simulation. Even though
	  impressive progress has been achieved with symbolic formal
	  verification techniques for linear systems, the verification
	  of non-linear, industrial scale CPS designs remains a
	  distant goal.</p> <p>In this talk, I present a simple yet
	  effective approach to automatically searching for property
	  violations in non-linear systems.  Our approach defines the
	  notion of robustness metrics over traces that can be used to
	  measure distances between simulation traces and properties
	  expressed in temporal logics.  As a result, robustness
	  metrics can naturally quantify how "close" a particular
	  simulation of the system is to violating a property of
	  interest.  By treating robustness metrics as an objective
	  function to minimize over the simulation traces of the
	  system, we can use many off-the-shelf global optimization
	  techniques to effectively steer the simulations towards a
	  falsification of the property being considered.</p>
	  <p>Despite the lack of strong formal guarantees, we find
	  that robustness-guided falsification is a promising approach
	  to searching for property violations in complex systems.  We
	  present the S-Taliro tool, an implementation of our approach
	  to reason about properties of non-linear systems modeled as
	  Simulink/Stateflow diagrams.  We present two interesting
	  case studies using S-Taliro, including a risk analysis of
	  insulin infusion pump usage by diabetic patients that models
	  the software in the pump in conjunction with the dynamics of
	  insulin/glucose regulatory system.</p>

	  Program Analysis for C++
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Program analyzes have been successful in finding serious
	  program defects such as NULL pointer accesses or buffer
	  overflows in programs written in C. However, industry relies
	  heavily on object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++.
	  This talk presents our recent advances in static analysis
	  for C++. It focuses on C++ specific difficulties such as
	  multiple inheritance, conversion from C++ strings to C
	  strings and vice versa, and C++ exception semantics.</p>

	  Probabilistic Approximation and Analysis Bio-pathways Dynamics
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>A system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is
	  often used to model the dynamics of a bio-chemical
	  network. Such systems are difficult to analyze. To get
	  around this, we construct a discrete probabilistic
	  approximation of the ODE dynamics as a dynamic Bayesian
	  network.  Consequently, pathway properties can be analyzed
	  using standard Bayesian inference techniques. Apart from
	  testing our method on ODEs models drawn from the biomodels
	  data base, we have used our technique in a combined
	  computational and experimental study of the human complement
	  system under inflammation conditions.  Our results are very
	  encouraging in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we
	  have extended the scalability of our approach via a GPU
	  implementation.</p>

	  Towards the Verification of Hybrid Data-Flow Languages
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Hybrid systems are used to model embedded computing
	  systems interacting with their physical environment. There
	  is a conceptual mismatch between high-level hybrid system
	  languages, like Simulink, which are used for simulation, and
	  hybrid automata, the most suitable representation for safety
	  verification. Indeed, in simulation languages the
	  interaction between discrete and continuous execution steps
	  is specified using the concept of zero-crossings, whereas
	  hybrid automata exploit the notion of staying conditions.
	  In this talk we first briefly present Zelus, a synchronous
	  data-flow language extended with ordinary differential
	  equations.  Then we propose a sound translation from a
	  Zelus-like hybrid data-flow formalism to logico-numerical
	  hybrid automata discussing various zero-crossing semantics
	  and the extent to which the original semantics is preserved.
	  At last we sketch how existing continuous reachability
	  analysis methods can be applied to logico-numerical hybrid
	  automata.</p>

	  <p>We describe BDDAPRON, a freely available library

	  <p>BDDAPRON provides ready-to-use logico-numerical
	  abstractions for combinations of finite-type and numerical
	  variables, as well as powerful symbolic manipulations of
	  expressions.</p>
	  <p>Algorithmically, BDDAPRON combines BDD techniques (using
	  the CUDD library) with numerical abstract domains provided
	  by the APRON library. We describe the principles behind this
	  combination and the various available options for the
	  computation of abstract transfer functions.</p>
	  <p>At last, we present some applications of the BDDAPRON
	  abstract domain to program verification, including recursive
	  program with pointers.</p>

	  What can the Garbage Collector compute efficiently? A
	  Language for Heap Assertions at Garbage Collection Time
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Finding bugs is among the most challenging tasks in
	  software development.  For this reason, modern software
	  development methodologies encourage programmers to use
	  assertions throughout their code to express the assumptions
	  they are making.  At runtime, these assertions then detect
	  whenever the assumptions do not match the program; in other
	  words, they detect bugs early.  However, traditional
	  assertion mechanisms in mainstream languages such as C or
	  Java are limited in their expressivity.</p>
	  <p>This talk presents DeAL, a rich heap assertion language
	  for Java that extends over the expressive power of
	  traditional assertions.  DeAL introduces additional
	  primitives to reason over heap layout, allowing programmers
	  to assert global invariants, ownership, and other properties
	  that would be impossible to express in traditional
	  assertions.</p>
	  <p>By design, all DeAL assertions require only a single heap
	  traversal and can execute as part of garbage collection.
	  Consequently, DeAL is not only expressive, but also ensures
	  a very low execution overhead.</p>

	<title>Building Verified Software with Dependent Types</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Recent years have seen intensive interest among
	  Programming Language (PL) researchers in connecting PL and
	  Verification.  Static analyses which once were primarily
	  intended for enabling optimizations in compilers are now
	  used also for program verification and bug finding.  Type
	  systems, which had been used to detect (either statically or
	  dynamically) low-level bugs, are now pushed to express
	  stronger and stronger semantic properties of code.  Arguably
	  the most powerful such systems known are so-called dependent
	  type systems, which combine programming and theorem proving,
	  and use rich types to express general logical specifications
	  of programs.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will describe ongoing work in my group to
	  design, prove, and implement dependently typed programming
	  languages, and apply them for challenging case studies.  I
	  will summarize the design of the Guru dependently typed
	  programming language, and explain how it overcomes some
	  traditional difficulties for dependently typed languages,
	  concerning general recursion and also the treatment of
	  equality.  For a case study, I will describe recent work of
	  my doctoral student Duckki Oe to implement a statically
	  verified modern SAT solver called versat in Guru. Versat
	  uses the efficient low-level data structures and algorithms
	  of modern solvers like Minisat, but has been statically
	  verified to be sound: if versat reports "unsat", then the
	  input formula is truly contradictory.  Versat can solve
	  benchmarks on the modern scale, including some from the SAT
	  Competition 2009.  I will conclude with a glimpse at a new
	  dependently typed language called Trellys, being designed
	  and implemented in a collaborative project with Stephanie
	  Weirich at U. Pennsylvania and Tim Sheard at Portland
	  State.</p>

	<title>Proving stabilisation of biological models</title>
	<abstract>
	  I will describe an efficient procedure for proving
	  stabilisation of biological systems when modeled as
	  qualitative networks or genetic regulatory networks. For
	  scalability, we use modular proof techniques, where
	  state-space exploration is applied only locally to small
	  pieces of the system rather than the entire system as a
	  whole. Our procedure exploits the observation that, in
	  practice, the form of modular proofs can be restricted to a
	  very limited set.  Using our new procedure, we have solved a
	  number of challenging published examples, including: a 3-D
	  model of the mammalian epidermis; a model of metabolic
	  networks operating in type-2 diabetes; a model of fate
	  determination of vulval precursor cells in the C. elegans
	  worm; and a model of pair-rule regulation during
	  segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. Our results show many
	  orders of magnitude speedup in cases where previous
	  stabilization proving techniques were known to succeed, and
	  new results in cases where tools had previously failed.

	<title>Symbolic Predictive Analysis for Concurrent Programs</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Multi-core and multi-processor systems are becoming
	  increasingly popular. However, our ability to effectively
	  harness the power of parallelism is predicated upon advances
	  in tools and algorithms for verifying concurrent
	  programs. Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to
	  verify, and a key reason for this is the behavioral
	  complexity resulting from the large number of interleavings
	  of concurrent threads.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will introduce a symbolic predictive
	  analysis for runtime detection of concurrency errors, by
	  monitoring and subsequently analyzing the execution traces
	  of a program. In this analysis, we first derive a symbolic
	  predictive model using the trace information collected at
	  run time as well as the program source code. What this model
	  captures are not just the given traces, but all possible
	  interleavings of events of these traces. Then we use
	  symbolic reasoning to check whether there are concurrency
	  errors in any of these interleavings. This is done by
	  capturing these interleavings and the error conditions using
	  a set of first-order logic formulas, and then deciding the
	  formulas using an off-the-shelf Satisfiability Modulo Theory
	  (SMT) solver.</p>

	<title>The Astr√©e Analyzer: Proving the absence of runtime
	errors automatically</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Runtime errors in embedded softwares may have disastrous
	  consequences, e.g. in transportation or energy production
	  systems.</p>
	  <p>The Astr√©e analyzer aims at proving the absence of
	  runtime errors in C programs and was designed specifically
	  for synchronous applications as found in fly-by-wire
	  systems. The analysis process is conservative, that is, it
	  may fail to establish the correctness of some safe programs,
	  but it is sound, that is it will report any runtime error.</p>
	  <p>Astr√©e performs Abstract Interpretation based static
	  analysis, that is abstract execution, using families of
	  predicates formed by abstract domains. Astr√©e relies on a
	  library of numerical and symbolic abstract domains, which
	  allow to capture salient properties of embedded softwares,
	  so as to establish absence of runtime errors. The analysis
	  process is fully automatic, and involves automatic
	  parameterization of the abstract domains.</p>
	  <p>We will present the underlying concepts of Astr√©e, and
	  examplify the use of the analyzer on a few selected
	  examples.</p>
	  <p>The Astr√©e analyzer has allowed to prove the absence of
	  runtime errors in industrial size avionics programs. As of
	  today, Absint Angewandte Informatik provides commercial
	  diffusion and support of Astr√©e.</p>

	<title>New methods for proving temporal properties of infinite-state systems</title>
	<abstract>
	  I will describe some new methods of proving temporal
	  properties of infinite-state programs.  Our approach takes
	  advantage of the fact that linear-temporal properties can
	  often be proved more efficiently using proof techniques
	  usually associated with the branching-time logic CTL.  The
	  caveat is that, in certain instances, nondeterminism in the
	  system's transition relation can cause CTL methods to report
	  counterexamples that are spurious in LTL. To address this
	  problem we describe an algorithm that, as it attempts to
	  apply CTL proof methods, finds and then removes problematic
	  nondeterminism via an analysis on the spurious
	  counterexamples. We must also develop CTL symbolic model
	  checking tools for infinite-state systems.

	<title>How to Build Your Own Bidirectional Programming Language</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Most programs get used in just one direction, from input
	  to output. But sometimes, having computed an output, we need
	  to be able to update this output and then "calculate
	  backwards" to find a correspondingly updated input. The
	  problem of writing such bidirectional transformations --
	  often called lenses -- arises in applications across a
	  multitude of domains and has been attacked from many
	  perspectives. Potential applications include synchronization
	  of replicated data, system configuration management tools
	  (such as RedHat's Augeas system), bidirectional
	  transformations between software models, and updatable
	  "security views."</p>
	  <p>The Harmony project at the University of Pennsylvania is
	  exploring a linguistic approach to bidirectional
	  programming, designing domain-specific languages in which
	  every expression simultaneously describes both parts of a
	  lens. When read from left to right, an expression denotes an
	  ordinary function that maps inputs to outputs. When read
	  from right to left, it denotes an "update translator" that
	  takes an input together with an updated output and produces
	  a new input that reflects the update. These languages share
	  some common elements with modern functional languages -- in
	  particular, they come with very expressive type systems. In
	  other respects, they are rather novel and surprising.</p>
	  <p>We have designed, implemented, and applied bi-directional
	  languages in three quite different domains: a language for
	  bidirectional transformations on trees (such as XML
	  documents), based on a collection of primitive bidirectional
	  tree transformation operations and
	  "bidirectionality-preserving" combining forms; a language
	  for bidirectional views of relational data, using
	  bidirectionalized versions of the operators of relational
	  algebra as primitives; and, most recently, a language for
	  bidirectional string transformations, with primitives based
	  on standard notations for finite-state transduction and a
	  type system based on regular expressions. The string case is
	  especially interesting, both in its own right and because it
	  exposes a number of foundational issues common to all
	  bidirectional programming languages in a simple and familiar
	  setting. We are also exploring how lenses and their types
	  can be enriched to embody privacy and integrity policies.</p>
	  <p>This talk explores the design of bidirectional languages,
	  starting from the very simplest imaginable variant
	  (bijective languages) and then developing several
	  refinements.</p>

	<title>Towards a Science of Parallel Programming</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>When parallel programming started in the 70s and 80s, it
	  was mostly art: languages such as functional and logic
	  programming languages were designed and appreciated mainly
	  for their elegance and beauty. More recently, parallel
	  programming has become engineering: conventional languages
	  like FORTRAN and C++ have been extended with constructs such
	  as OpenMP, and we now spend our time benchmarking and
	  tweaking large programs nobody understands to obtain
	  performance improvements of 5-10%. In spite of all this
	  activity, we have few insights into how to write parallel
	  programs to exploit the performance potential of multicore
	  processors.</p>
	  <p>To break this impasse, we need a science of parallel
	  programming. In this talk, I will introduce a concept called
	  "amorphous data-parallelism" that provides a simple, unified
	  picture of parallelism in a host of diverse applications
	  ranging from mesh generation/refinement/partitioning to SAT
	  solvers, maxflow algorithms, stencil computations, and
	  event-driven simulation. Then I will present a natural
	  classification that provides insight into the structure of
	  parallelism and locality in these algorithms and into
	  appropriate language and systems support for exploiting this
	  parallelism.</p>

	  expect from web apps. It supports performance-oriented
	  features generally absent from web application programming
	  environments, such as thread support, instruction set
	  extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and
	  hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open
	  architecture designed to leverage existing web standards,
	  and to encourage community review and third-party
	  tools. Overall, Google's desktop efforts seek to enable new
	  Web applications, improve end-user experience, and enable a

	  computing. Google has open sourced many of our desktop
	  efforts, in part to encourage collaboration and independent

	<title>Introducing the Sparse Polyhedral Framework</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Loops often dominate the execution time of
	  applications. Various transformation frameworks have been
	  developed to enable the automatic compile-time
	  transformation of loops. Many of the existing models fit
	  within the polyhedral framework and although they are quite
	  powerful, they are restricted to compile-time
	  transformations and loop bounds and memory accesses that are
	  affine or can be approximated as affine.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will present the Sparse Polyhedral
	  Framework (SPF). The SPF builds on the polyhedral
	  programming model, but is also capable of expressing and
	  supporting the code generation for run-time reordering
	  transformations implemented with inspector/executor
	  strategies. I will then discuss the idea of abstractions for
	  exposing transformation frameworks in performance programmer
	  models.</p>

	<title>Algorithmic Program Synthesis with Partial Programs</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Why hasn't Moore's Law revolutionize programming?  In
	  model checking, cycles fuel bug discovery, improving code
	  quality, but programmers still write programs with their
	  bare hands.  In fact, their work has not changed much since
	  the CRT terminal, except that they think in better
	  languages.</p>
	  <p>Program synthesis might be a way to reduce
	  the programmer's cognitive load.  Synthesizers have derived
	  programs that were highly efficient, and sometimes even
	  surprising.  Of course, they had to be first "programmed"
	  with the human insights about the domain at hand.</p>
	  <p>Which brings us to a key problem in program synthesis ---
	  how to communicate human expertise to the synthesizer.  In
	  deductive synthesis, this expertise is captured in a domain
	  theory.  Often elusive even to formally trained experts, a
	  domain theory is probably not a shortcut to programmer
	  productivity.</p> <p>This talk will describe a growing
	  family of synthesizers based on partial programs.  Their
	  premise is that programs can be decomposed into insight and
	  mechanics: if the programmer encodes her insight as a
	  partial program, the mechanics can then be synthesized given
	  a specification.  Partial programs lend themselves to
	  algorithmic synthesis: rather than deducing a program with a
	  theorem prover, algorithmic synthesis finds the program in a
	  space of candidate implementations described by the partial
	  program.</p>
	  <p>Among five synthesizers, I will describe an algorithm for
	  finding a candidate by constraint solving, rather than via
	  generate-and-test, and a system for programming with angelic
	  non-determinism which computes the insight into a
	  programming problem.</p>

	<p>Software-defined networking (SDN) programs must simultaneously describe static forwarding behavior and dynamic updates in response to events. Event-driven updates are critical to get right, but difficult to implement correctly due to the high degree of concurrency in networks. Existing SDN platforms offer weak guarantees that can break application invariants, leading to problems such as dropped packets, degraded performance, security violations, etc. This paper introduces EVENT-DRIVEN CONSISTENT UPDATES that are guaranteed to preserve well-defined behaviors when transitioning between configurations in response to events. We propose NETWORK EVENT STRUCTURES (NESs) to model constraints on updates, such as which events can be enabled simultaneously and causal dependencies between events. We define an extension of the NetKAT language with mutable state, give semantics to stateful programs using NESs, and discuss provably-correct strategies for implementing NESs in SDNs. Finally, we evaluate our approach empirically, demonstrating that it gives well-defined consistency guarantees while avoiding expensive synchronization and packet buffering.</p>

	<p>We study the problem of falsifying reachability properties of real-time control software acting in a closed-loop with a given model of the plant dynamics. Our approach employs numerical techniques to simulate a plant model, which may be highly nonlinear and hybrid, in combination with symbolic simulation of the controller software. The state-space and input-space of the plant are systematically searched using a plant abstraction that is implicitly defined by "quantization" of the plant state, but never explicitly constructed. Simultaneously, the controller behaviors are explored using a symbolic execution of the control software. On-the-fly exploration of the overall closed-loop abstraction results in abstract counterexamples, which are used to refine the plant abstraction iteratively until a concrete violation is found. Empirical evaluation of our approach shows its promise in treating controller software that has precise, formal semantics, using an exact method such as symbolic execution, while using numerical simulations to produce abstractions of the underlying plant model that is often an approximation of the actual plant. We also discuss a preliminary comparison of our approach with techniques that are primarily simulation-based.</p>

	<p>We consider the problem of reasoning about the probability of assertion violations in straight-line, nonlinear computations involving uncertain quantities modeled as random variables. Such computations are quite common in many areas such as cyber-physical systems and numerical computation. Our approach extends probabilistic affine forms, an interval-based calculus for precisely tracking how the distribution of a given program variable depends on uncertain inputs modeled as noise symbols. We extend probabilistic affine forms using the precise tracking of dependencies between noise symbols combined with the expectations and higher order moments of the noise symbols. Next, we show how to prove bounds on the probabilities that program variables take on specific values by using concentration of measure inequalities. Thus, we enable a new approach to this problem that explicitly avoids subdividing the domain of inputs, as is commonly done in the related work. We illustrate the approach in this paper on a variety of challenging benchmark examples, and thus study its applicability to uncertainty propagation.</p>

	<p>Martingale theory yields a powerful set of tools that have recently been used to prove quantitative properties of stochastic systems such as stochastic safety and qualitative properties such as almost sure termination. In this paper, we examine proof techniques for establishing almost sure persistence and recurrence properties of infinite-state discrete time stochastic systems. A persistence property FG(P) specifies that almost all executions of the stochastic system eventually reach P and stay there forever. Likewise, a recurrence property GF(Q) specifies that a target set Q is visited infinitely often by almost all executions of the stochastic system. Our approach extends classic ideas on the use of Lyapunov-like functions to establish persistence and recurrence properties. Next, we extend known constraint-based invariant synthesis techniques to deduce the necessary supermartingale expressions to partly mechanize such proofs. We illustrate our techniques on a set of interesting examples.</p>

        <p>When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to
        reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.
        Symbolic set abstractions provide building blocks that can be used to
        partition elements, relate partitions to other partitions, and determine
        the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing any concrete
        values. To address the simultaneous challenges of scalability and
        precision, we formalize and implement an interface for symbolic set
        abstractions and construct multiple abstract domains relying on both
        specialized data structures and off-the-shelf theorem provers. We
        develop techniques for lifting existing domains to improve performance
        and precision. We evaluate these domains on real-world data structure
        analysis problems.</p>

	<p>We present <em>jumping</em>, a form of selective control-flow abstraction useful for improving the scalability of goal-directed static analyses. Jumping is useful for analyzing programs with complex control-flow such as <em>event-driven</em> systems. In such systems, accounting for orderings between certain events is important for precision, yet analyzing the product graph of all possible event orderings is intractable. Jumping solves this problem by allowing the analysis to selectively abstract away control-flow between events irrelevant to a goal query while preserving information about the ordering of relevant events. We present a framework for designing sound jumping analyses and create an instantiation of the framework for performing precise inter-event analysis of Android applications. Our experimental evaluation showed that using jumping to augment a precise goal-directed analysis with inter-event reasoning enabled our analysis to prove 90--97\% of dereferences safe across our benchmarks.</p>

	<p>Over the past thirty years, there has been significant progress in developing general-purpose, language-based approaches to incremental computation, which aims to efficiently update the result of a computation when an input is changed. A key design challenge in such approaches is how to provide efficient incremental support for a broad range of programs. In this paper, we argue that first-class names are a critical linguistic feature for efficient incremental computation. Names identify computations to be reused across differing runs of a program, and making them first class gives programmers a high level of control over reuse. We demonstrate the benefits of names by presenting Nominal Adapton, an ML-like language for incremental computation with names. We describe how to use Nominal Adapton to efficiently incrementalize several standard programming patterns‚Äîincluding maps, folds, and unfolds‚Äîand show how to build efficient, incremental probabilistic trees and tries. Since Nominal Adapton's implementation is subtle, we formalize it as a core calculus and prove it is from-scratch consistent, meaning it always produces the same answer as simply re-running the computation. Finally, we demonstrate that Nominal Adapton can provide large speedups over both from-scratch computation and Adapton, a previous state-of-the-art incremental computation system.</p>

      <abstract>
	  <p>Shape analysis aims to infer precise structural properties of
  imperative memory states and has been applied heavily to verify
  safety properties on imperative code over pointer-based data
  structures. Recent advances in shape analysis based on separation
  logic has leveraged summarization predicates that describe unbounded
  heap regions like lists or trees using inductive
  definitions. Unfortunately, data structures with <em>unstructured
    sharing</em>, such as graphs, are challenging to describe and reason
  about in such frameworks.
  In particular, when the sharing is unstructured, it cannot be described
  inductively in a local manner.
  In this paper, we propose a global
  abstraction of sharing based on set-valued variables that when
  integrated with inductive definitions enables the specification and
  shape analysis of structures with unstructured sharing.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>We present an approach and tool for general-purpose modeling of Android for static analysis.  Our approach is to explicate the reflective bridge between the Android framework and an application to make the framework source amenable to static analysis.  Our Droidel tool does this by automatically generating application-specific stubs that summarize the reflective behavior for a particular app.  The result is a program with a single entry-point that can be processed by any existing Java analysis platform (e.g., Soot, WALA, Chord).  We compared call graphs constructed using Droidel to call graphs constructed using a state-of-the-art Android model and found that Droidel captures more concrete behaviors.

	<p>Software-defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the networking
industry, but current SDN programming platforms do not
provide automated mechanisms for updating global configurations
on the fly. Implementing updates by hand is challenging for SDN
programmers because networks are distributed systems with hundreds
or thousands of interacting nodes. Even if initial and final
configurations are correct, naively updating individual nodes can
lead to incorrect transient behaviors, including loops, black holes,
and access control violations. This paper presents an approach for
automatically synthesizing updates that are guaranteed to preserve
specified properties. We formalize network updates as a distributed
programming problem and develop a synthesis algorithm based on
counterexample-guided search and incremental model checking.
We describe a prototype implementation, and present results from
experiments on real-world topologies and properties demonstrating
that our tool scales to updates involving over one-thousand nodes.</p>

	<p>Dynamic language library developers face a challenging problem:
	ensuring that their libraries will behave correctly for a wide variety
	of client programs without having access to those client programs. This
	problem stems from the common use of two defining features for dynamic
	languages: callbacks into client code and complex manipulation of
	attribute names within objects. To remedy this problem, we introduce two
	state-spanning abstractions. To analyze callbacks, the first abstraction
	desynchronizes a heap, allowing partitions of the heap that may be
	affected by a callback to an unknown function to be frozen in the state
	prior to the call. To analyze object attribute manipulation, building
	upon an abstraction for dynamic language heaps, the second abstraction
	tracks attribute name/value pairs across the execution of a library. We
	implement these abstractions and use them to verify modular
	specifications of class-, trait-, and mixin-implementing libraries.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>This paper presents a controller synthesis approach using disjunctive polyhedral abstract interpretation. Our approach synthesizes infinite time-horizon controllers for safety properties with discrete-time, linear plant model and a switching feedback controller that is suitable for time-triggered implementations. The core idea behind our approach is to perform an abstract interpretation over disjunctions of convex polyhedra to identify states that are potentially uncontrollable. Complementing this set yields the set of controllable states, starting from which, the safety property can be guaranteed by an appropriate control function. Since, a straightforward disjunctive domain is computationally inefficient, we present an abstract domain based on a state partitioning scheme that allows us to efficiently control the complexity of the intermediate representations. Next, we focus on the automatic generation of controller implementation from our final fixed point. We show that a balanced tree approach can yield efficient controller code with guarantees on the worst-case execution time of the controller. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a suite of benchmarks, comparing different instantiations with related synthesis tools. Our evaluation shows that our approach can successfully synthesize controller implementations for small to medium sized benchmarks.</p>

	<p>In this paper, we present an approach for finding violations of safety properties of hybrid systems. Existing approaches search for complete system trajectories that begin from an initial state and reach some unsafe state. We present an approach that searches over segmented trajectories, consisting of a sequence of segments starting from any system state. Adjacent segments may have gaps, which our approach then seeks to narrow iteratively. We show that segmented trajectories are actually paths in the abstract state graph obtained by tiling the state space with cells. Instead of creating the prohibitively large abstract state graph explicitly, our approach implicitly performs a randomized search on it using a {em scatter-and-simulate} technique. This involves repeated simulations, graph search to find likeliest abstract counterexamples, and iterative refinement of the abstract state graph. Finally, we demonstrate our technique on a number of case studies ranging from academic examples to models of industrial-scale control systems.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>In dynamic languages, objects are <em>open</em>&emdash;they support iteration over and dynamic addition/deletion of their attributes. Open objects, because they have an unbounded number of attributes, are difficult to abstract without a priori knowledge of all or nearly all of the attributes and thus pose a significant challenge for precise static analysis. To address this challenge, we present the HOO (Heap with Open Objects) abstraction that can precisely represent and infer properties about open-object-manipulating programs without any knowledge of specific attributes.  It achieves this by building upon a relational abstract domain for sets that is used to reason about partitions of object attributes.  An implementation of the resulting static analysis is used to verify specifications for dynamic language framework code that makes extensive use of open objects, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

	<p>The breadth and depth of heap properties that can be inferred by the union of today's shape analyses is quite astounding.  Yet, achieving scalability while supporting a wide range of complex data structures in a generic way remains a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we propose a way to side-step this issue by defining a generic abstract domain combinator for combining memory abstractions on disjoint regions. In essence, our abstract domain construction is to the separating conjunction in separation logic as the reduced product construction is to classical, non-separating conjunction. This approach eases the design of the analysis as memory abstract domains can be re-used by applying our separating conjunction domain combinator. And more importantly, this combinator enables an analysis designer to easily create a combined domain that applies computationally-expensive abstract domains only where it is required.</p>

As a library, it is useful for inferring relational data invariants in programs that manipulate data structures.  As a testbed, it allows easy extension of widening and join heuristics, enabling adaptations to new and varied applications.  In this paper we present the architecture of the library, guidelines on how to select heuristics, and an example instantiation of the library using the Apron library to verify set-manipulating programs.</p>

	<p>We present a generic analysis approach to the <em>imperative
	relationship update problem</em>, in which destructive updates
	temporarily violate a global invariant of interest. Such invariants can
	be conveniently and concisely specified with dependent refinement types,
	which are efficient to check flow-insensitively. Unfortunately, while
	traditional flow-insensitive type checking is fast, it is inapplicable
	when the desired invariants can be temporarily broken. To overcome this
	limitation, past works have directly ratcheted up the complexity of the
	type analysis and associated type invariants, leading to inefficient
	analysis and verbose specifications. In contrast, we propose a
	<em>generic lifting</em> of modular refinement type analyses with a
	symbolic analysis to efficiently and effectively check concise
	invariants that hold <em>almost everywhere</em>. The result is an
	efficient, highly modular flow-insensitive type analysis to
	<em>optimistically</em> check the preservation of global relationship
	invariants that can fall back to a precise, disjunctive symbolic
	analysis when the optimistic assumption is violated. This technique
	permits programmers to temporarily break and then re-establish
	relationship invariants&emdash;a flexibility that is crucial for
	checking relationships in real-world, imperative languages. A
	significant challenge is selectively violating the global type
	consistency invariant over heap locations, which we achieve via
	<em>almost type-consistent heaps</em>. To evaluate our approach, we have
	encoded the problem of verifying the safety of reflective method calls
	in dynamic languages as a refinement type checking problem. Our analysis
	is capable of validating reflective call safety at interactive speeds on
	commonly-used Objective-C libraries and applications.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>Precise heap reachability information is a prerequisite for many
  static verification clients. However, the typical scenario is that
  the available heap information, computed by say an up-front
  points-to analysis, is not precise enough for the client of
  interest. This imprecise heap information in turn leads to a deluge
  of false alarms for the tool user to triage. Our position is to
  approach the false alarm problem not just by improving the up-front
  analysis but by also employing after-the-fact, goal-directed
  <em>refutation analyses</em> that yield targeted precision
  improvements. We have investigated refutation analysis in the
  context of detecting statically a class of Android memory leaks. For
  this client, we have found the necessity for an overall analysis
  capable of path-sensitive reasoning interprocedurally and with
  strong updates---a level of precision difficult to achieve globally
  in an up-front manner. Instead, our approach uses a
  refutation analysis that mixes highly precise, goal-directed
  reasoning with facts derived from the up-front analysis
  to prove alarms false and thus enabling effective and sound
  filtering of the overall list of alarms.</p>

	<p>The aim of static analysis is to infer invariants about programs that are precise enough to establish semantic properties, such as the absence of run-time errors. Broadly speaking, there are two major branches of static analysis for imperative programs.  Pointer and <em>shape</em> analyses focus on inferring properties of pointers, dynamically-allocated memory, and recursive data structures, while <em>numeric</em> analyses seek to derive invariants on numeric values. Although simultaneous inference of shape-numeric invariants is often needed, this case is especially challenging and is not particularly well explored.  Notably, simultaneous shape-numeric inference raises complex issues in the design of the static analyzer itself.
In this paper, we study the construction of such shape-numeric, static analyzers. We set up an abstract interpretation framework that allows us to reason about simultaneous shape-numeric properties by combining shape and numeric abstractions into a modular, expressive abstract domain.  Such a modular structure is highly desirable to make its formalization and implementation easier to do and get correct. To achieve this, we choose a concrete semantics that can be abstracted step-by-step, while preserving a high level of expressiveness.  The structure of abstract operations (i.e., transfer, join, and comparison) follows the structure of this semantics.  The advantage of this construction is to divide the analyzer in modules and functors that implement abstractions of distinct features.</p>

	<p>We present techniques for the analysis of infinite state
	probabilistic programs to synthesize probabilistic invariants and prove
	almost-sure termination. Our analysis is based on the notion of (super)
	martingales from probability theory. First, we define the concept of
	(super) martingales for loops in probabilistic programs. Next, we
	present the use of concentration of measure inequalities to bound the
	values of martingales with high probability. This directly allows us to
	infer probabilistic bounds on assertions involving the program
	variables. Next, we present the notion of a super martingale ranking
	function (SMRF) to prove almost sure termination of probabilistic
	programs. Finally, we extend constraint-based techniques to synthesize
	martingales and super-martingale ranking functions for probabilistic
	programs. We present some applications of our approach to reason about
	invariance and termination of small but complex probabilistic programs.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>Programs written in modern languages perform intricate
	manipulations of containers such as arrays, lists, dictionaries,
	and sets. We present an abstract interpretation-based framework
	for automatically inferring <em>relations</em> between the set of values
	stored in these containers. Relations include inclusion relations over
	unions and intersections, as well as quantified relationships with
	scalar variables. We develop an abstract domain constructor that builds
	a container domain out of a
	<em>Quantified Union-Intersection Constraint</em> (QUIC) graph
	parameterized by an arbitrary <em>base domain</em>.  We instantiate
	our domain with a polyhedral base domain and evaluate it on
	programs extracted from the Python test suite.  Over traditional,
	non-relational domains, we find significant precision improvements
	with minimal performance cost.</p>

      <abstract>
	  <p>We present a precise, path-sensitive static analysis for reasoning about
	  <em>heap reachability</em>; that is, whether an object can be reached
	  from another variable or object via pointer dereferences. Precise
	  reachability information is useful for a number of clients, including
	  static detection of a class of Android memory leaks. For this client,
	  we found that the heap reachability information computed by a
	  state-of-the-art points-to analysis was too imprecise, leading to
	  numerous false-positive leak reports. Our analysis combines a symbolic
	  execution capable of path-sensitivity and strong updates with abstract
	  heap information computed by an initial flow-insensitive points-to
	  analysis. This novel <em>mixed</em> representation allows us to
	  achieve both precision and scalability by leveraging the pre-computed
	  points-to facts to guide execution and prune infeasible paths. We have
	  evaluated our techniques in the <span style="font-variant:
	  small-caps">Thresher</span> tool, which we used to find several
	  developer-confirmed leaks in Android applications.</p>

	<p>We propose an approach for the static analysis of probabilistic
	programs that sense, manipulate, and control based on uncertain
	data. Examples include programs used in risk analysis, medical
	decision making and cyber-physical systems. Correctness properties
	of such programs take the form of <em>queries</em> that seek the
	probabilities of assertions over program variables.  We present a
	static analysis approach that provides guaranteed interval bounds on
	the values (assertion probabilities) of such queries.  First, we
	observe that for probabilistic programs, it is possible to conclude
	facts about the behavior of the entire program by choosing a finite,
	<em>adequate set</em> of its paths. We provide strategies for choosing
	such a set of paths and verifying its adequacy.  The queries are
	evaluated over each path by a combination of symbolic execution and
	probabilistic volume-bound computations. Each path yields interval
	bounds that can be summed up with a "coverage"  bound to yield an
	interval that encloses the probability of assertion for the program
	as a whole.  We demonstrate promising results on a suite of
	benchmarks from many different sources including robotic
	manipulators and medical decision making programs.</p>

	<p>Fixed point digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a
	wide variety of digital processing and control systems. Common errors
        in fixed point filters include arithmetic round-off (truncation) errors,
	overflows and the presence of limit cycles. These errors can potentially
	compromise the correctness of the system as a whole. Traditionally digital
	filters have been verified using a combination of design techniques from control
	theory and extensive testing. In this paper, we examine the use of formal
	verification techniques as part of the design flow for fixed point digital
	filters. We study two classes of verification techniques involving bit-precise
	analysis and real-valued error approximations, respectively. We empirically
	evaluate several variants of these two fundamental approaches for verifying
	fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We design our comparison to
	reveal the best possible approach towards verifying real-world designs of
	infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. Our study compares the
	strengths and weaknesses of different verification techniques for digital
	filters and suggests efficient approaches using modern
	satisfiability-modulo-theories solvers (SMT) and hardware model checkers. This
	manuscript extends our previous work evaluating bounded verification, where a
	limited number of iterations of the system are explored, with unbounded
	verification, where an unlimited number of iterations of the system are
	considered. Doing so allows us to evaluate techniques that can prove the
	correctness of fixed point digital filter implementations.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>Real-world data structures are often enhanced with additional
	pointers capturing alternative paths through a basic inductive skeleton
        (e.g., back pointers, head pointers). From the static analysis point of view,
	we must obtain several interlocking shape invariants. At the same time, it is
	well understood in abstract interpretation design that supporting a separation
	of concerns is critically important to designing powerful static analyses.
	Such a separation of concerns is often obtained via a reduced product on a
	case-by-case basis. In this paper, we lift this idea to abstract domains for
	shape analyses, introducing a domain combination operator for memory
	abstractions. As an example, we present <em>simultaneous separating shape
	graphs</em>, a product construction that combines instances of
	separation logic-based shape domains. The key enabler for this
	construction is a static analysis on inductive data structure
	definitions to derive relations between the skeleton and the alternative
	paths. From the engineering standpoint, this construction allows each
	component to reason independently about different aspects of the data
	structure invariant and then separately exchange information via a
	reduction operator. From the usability standpoint, we enable describing
	a data structure invariant in terms of several inductive definitions
	that hold simultaneously.</p>

        <p>We examine the problem of inferring invariants for
        parametrized systems. Parametrized systems are concurrent
        systems consisting of an a priori unbounded number of process
        instances running the same program. Such systems are commonly
        encountered in many situations including device drivers,
        distributed systems, and robotic swarms. In this paper we
        describe a technique that enables leveraging off-the-shelf
        invariant generators designed for sequential programs to infer
        invariants of parametrized systems. The central challenge in
        invariant inference for parametrized systems is that n√§ƒ±vely
        exploding the transition system with all interleavings is not
        just impractical but impossible. In our approach, the key
        enabler is the notion of a reÔ¨Çective abstraction that we prove
        has an important correspondence with inductive
        invariants. This correspondence naturally gives rise to an
        iterative invariant generation procedure that alternates
        between computing candidate invariants and creating reÔ¨Çective
        abstractions.</p>

	<p>A static analysis design is <em>sufficient</em> if it can
	prove the property of interest with an acceptable number of
	false alarms.  Ultimately, the only way to confirm that an
	analysis design is sufficient is to implement it and run it on
	real-world programs.  If the evaluation shows that the design
	is insufficient, the designer must return to the drawing board
	and repeat the process&emdash;wasting expensive implementation
	effort over and over again.  In this paper, we make the
	observation that there is a minimal range of code needed to
	prove a property of interest under an ideal static analysis;
	we call such a range of code a <em>validation scope</em>.
	Armed with this observation, we create a dynamic measurement
	framework that quantifies validation scopes and thus enables
	designers to rule out insufficient designs at lower cost.  A
	novel attribute of our framework is the ability to model
	aspects of static reasoning using dynamic execution
	measurements.  To evaluate the flexibility of our framework,
	we instantiate it on an example property&emdash;null
	dereference errors&emdash;and measure validation scopes on
	real-world programs. We use a broad range of metrics that
	capture the difficulty of analyzing programs along varying
	dimensions.  We also examine how validation scopes evolve as
	developers fix null dereference errors and as code matures.
	We find that bug fixes shorten validation scopes, that longer
	validation scopes are more likely to be buggy, and that
	overall validation scopes are remarkably stable as programs
	evolve.</p>

        <p>Abstraction refinement is an effective verification
        technique for automatically proving safety properties of
        software. Application of this technique in shape analyses has proved
        impractical as core components of existing refinement techniques such
        as backward analysis, general conjunction, and identification of
        unreachable but doomed states are computationally infeasible in such
        domains.</p>
        <p>We propose a new method to diagnose proof failures to
        be used in a refinement scheme for Separation Logic‚Äìbased shape
        analyses. To check feasibility of abstract error traces, we perform
        Bounded Model Checking over the traces using a novel encoding into
        SMT. A subsequent diagnosis finds discontinuities on infeasible
        traces, and identifies doomed states admitted by the abstraction. To
        construct doomed states, we give a model-finding algorithm for
        ‚Äúsymbolic heap‚Äù Separation Logic formulas, employing the execution
        machinery of the feasibility checker to search for concrete
        counter-examples. The diagnosis has been implemented in SLAyer, and we
        present a simple scheme for refining the abstraction of hierarchical
        data structures, and illustrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from
        the SLAyer test suite.</p>

        <p>
          In this paper, we define timed relational abstractions for
          verifying sampled data control systems. Sampled data control
          systems consist of a plant, modeled as a hybrid system and a
          synchronous controller, modeled as a discrete transition
          system. The controller computes control inputs and/or sends
          control events to the plant based on the periodically
          sampled state of the plant. The correctness of the system
          depends on the controller design as well as an appropriate
          choice of the controller sampling period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach constructs a timed relational abstraction of
          the hybrid plant by replacing the continuous plant dynamics
          by relations. These relations map a state of the plant to
          states reachable within the sampling time period. We present
          techniques for building timed relational abstractions, while
          taking care of discrete transitions that can be taken by the
          plant between samples. The resulting abstractions are better
          suited for the verification of sampled data control
          systems. The abstractions focus on the states that can be
          observed by the controller at the sample times, while
          abstracting away behaviors between sample times
          conservatively. The resulting abstractions are discrete,
          infinite-state transition systems. Thus conventional
          verification tools can be used to verify safety properties
          of these abstractions. We use k-induction to prove safety
          properties and bounded model checking (BMC) to find
          potential falsifications. We present our idea, its
          implementation and results on many benchmark examples.

        <p>A SAT-based incremental, inductive algorithm for model
        checking CTL properties is proposed. As in classic CTL model
        checking, the parse graph of the property shapes the
        analysis. However, in the proposed algorithm, called IICTL,
        the analysis is directed by task states that are pushed down
        the parse tree. To each node is associated over- and
        under-approximations to the set of states satisfying that
        node‚Äôs property; these approximations are refined until a
        proof that the property does or does not hold is
        obtained. Each CTL operator corresponds naturally to an
        incremental sub-query: given a task state, an EX node executes
        a SAT query; an EU node applies IC3; and an EG node applies
        FAIR. In each case, the query result provides more general
        information than necessary to satisfy the task. When a query
        is satisfiable, the returned trace is generalized using
        forall-exists reasoning, during which IC3 is applied to obtain
        new reachability information that enables greater
        generalization. When a query is unsatisfiable, the proof
        provides the generalization. In this way, property-directed
        abstraction is achieved.

      <abstract>
	<p>An incremental algorithm for model checking progress
	properties is proposed. It follows from the following insight:
	any SCC-closed region of a system‚Äôs state graph can be
	represented by a sequence of inductive assertions. Each
	iteration of the algorithm selects a set of states, called a
	skeleton, that together satisfy all fairness conditions; it
	then applies safety model checkers to attempt to connect the
	states into a reachable fair cycle. If this attempt fails, the
	resulting learned lemma takes one of two forms: an inductive
	reachability assertion that shows that at least one state of
	the skeleton is unreachable, or an inductive wall that deÔ¨Ånes
	two SCC-closed regions of the state graph. Subsequent
	skeletons must be chosen entirely from one side of the
	wall. Because a lemma often applies more generally than to the
	one skeleton from which it was derived, property-directed
	abstraction is achieved. The algorithm is highly
	parallelizable.</p>

	<p>We present techniques for determining the precision gap
	between Andersen's points-to analysis and precise
	flow-insensitive points-to analysis in practice.  While
	previous work has shown that such a gap may exist, no
	efficient algorithm for precise flow-insensitive analysis is
	known, making measurement of the gap on real-world programs
	difficult.  We give an algorithm for precise flow-insensitive
	analysis of programs with finite memory, based on a novel
	technique for refining any points-to analysis with a search
	for flow-insensitive witnesses.  We give a compact symbolic
	encoding of the technique that enables computing the search
	using a tuned SAT solver.  We also present extensions of the
	algorithm that enable computing lower and upper bounds on the
	precision gap in the presence of dynamic memory allocation. In
	our experimental evaluation over a suite of small- to
	medium-sized C programs, we never observed a precision gap
	between Andersen's analysis and the precise analysis. In other
	words, Andersen's analysis computed a precise flow-insensitive
	result for all of our benchmarks.  Hence, we conclude that
	while better algorithms for the precise flow-insensitive
	analysis are still of theoretical interest, their practical
	impact for C programs is likely to be negligible.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p> In this paper, we define relational abstractions of hybrid systems.
  A relational abstraction is obtained by replacing the continuous
  dynamics in each mode by a binary transition relation that relates a
  state of the system to any state that can potentially be reached at
  some future time instant using the continuous dynamics.  We
  construct relational abstractions by reusing template-based
  invariant generation techniques for continuous systems described by
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).  As a result, we abstract a
  given hybrid system as a purely discrete, infinite-state system.  We
  apply k-induction to this abstraction to prove safety properties,
  and use bounded model-checking to find potential falsifications.  We
  present the basic underpinnings of our approach and demonstrate its
  use on many benchmark systems to derive simple and usable
  abstractions. </p>

 <p>      We present abstraction techniques that transform a given non-linear
  dynamical system into a linear system, such that, invariant
  properties of the resulting linear abstraction can be used to infer
  invariants for the original system. The abstraction techniques rely
  on a change of bases transformation that associates each state
  variable of the abstract system with a function involving the state
  variables of the original system. We present conditions under which
  a given change of basis transformation for a non-linear system can
  define an abstraction. </p>

<p>  Furthermore, we present a technique to discover, given a non-linear
  system, if a change of bases transformation involving degree-bounded
  polynomials yielding a linear system abstraction exists. If so, our
  technique yields the resulting abstract linear system, as well. This
  approach is further extended to search for a change of bases
  transformation that abstracts a given non-linear system into a
  system of linear differential inclusions.  Our techniques enable the
  use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer invariants
  for non-linear systems. We present preliminary evidence of the
  practical feasibility of our ideas using a prototype implementation. </p>

stochastic optimization techniques including Monte-Carlo methods and
Ant-Colony Optimization. Among the advantages of the toolbox is the
seamless integration inside the Matlab environment, which is widely

  <p>Template polyhedra generalize weakly relational domains by
  specifying arbitrary fixed linear expressions on the left-hand sides
  of inequalities and undetermined constants on the right. The domain
  operations required for analysis over template polyhedra can be
  computed in polynomial time using linear programming.  In this
  paper, we introduce the generalized template polyhedral domain that
  extends template polyhedra using fixed left-hand side expressions
  with bilinear forms involving program variables and unknown
  parameters to the right. We prove that the domain operations over
  generalized templates can be defined as the ``best possible
  abstractions'' of the corresponding polyhedral domain
  operations. The resulting analysis can straddle the entire space of
  linear relation analysis starting from the template domain to the
  full polyhedral domain.</p>


<p>  We show that analysis in the generalized template domain can be
  performed by dualizing the join, post-condition and widening
  operations.  We also investigate the special case of template
  polyhedra wherein each bilinear form has at most two parameters. For
  this domain, we use the special properties of two dimensional
  polyhedra and techniques from fractional linear programming to
  derive domain operations that can be implemented in polynomial time
  over the number of variables in the program and the size of the
  polyhedra. We present applications of generalized template polyhedra
  to strengthen previously obtained invariants by converting them into
  templates.  We describe an experimental evaluation of an
  implementation over several benchmark systems.</p>

	<p>Several programming languages are beginning to integrate
	static and dynamic typing, including Racket (formerly PLT
	Scheme), Perl 6, and C# 4.0 and the research languages Sage
	(Gronski, Knowles, Tomb, Freund, and Flanagan, 2006) and Thorn
	(Wrigstad, Eugster, Field, Nystrom, and Vitek, 2009). However,
	an important open question remains, which is how to add
	parametric polymorphism to languages that combine static and
	dynamic typing. We present a system that permits a value of
	dynamic type to be cast to a polymorphic type and vice versa,
	with relational parametricity enforced by a kind of dynamic
	sealing along the lines proposed by Matthews and Ahmed (2008)
	and Neis, Dreyer, and Rossberg (2009). Our system includes a
	notion of blame, which allows us to show that when casting
	between a more-precise type and a less-precise type, any cast
	failures are due to the less-precisely-typed portion of the
	program. We also show that a cast from a subtype to its
	supertype cannot fail.</p>

	<p>Interprocedural program analysis is often performed by
	computing procedure summaries.  While possible, computing
	adequate summaries is difficult, particularly in the presence
	of recursive procedures.  In this paper, we propose a
	complementary framework for interprocedural analysis based on
	a direct abstraction of the calling context.  Specifically,
	our approach exploits the inductive structure of a calling
	context by treating it directly as a stack of activation
	records.  We then build an abstraction based on separation
	logic with inductive definitions.  A key element of this
	abstract domain is the use of parameters to refine the meaning
	of such call stack summaries and thus express relations across
	activation records and with the heap.  In essence, we define
	an abstract interpretation-based analysis framework for
	recursive programs that permits a fluid per call site
	abstraction of the call stack&emdash;much like how shape analyzers
	enable a fluid per program point abstraction of the heap.</p>

	<p>Electronic, software-managed mechanisms using, for example,

	<p>Static analysis designers must carefully balance precision
	and efficiency.  In our experience, many static analysis tools
	are built around an elegant, core algorithm, but that
	algorithm is then extensively tweaked to add just enough
	precision for the coding idioms seen in practice, without
	sacrificing too much efficiency.  There are several downsides
	to adding precision in this way: the tool's implementation
	becomes much more complicated; it can be hard for an end-user
	to interpret the tool's results; and as software systems vary
	tremendously in their coding styles, it may require
	significant algorithmic engineering to enhance a tool to
	perform well in a particular software domain.</p>
	<p>In this paper, we present Mix, a novel system that mixes
	type checking and symbolic execution.  The key aspect of our
	approach is that these analyses are applied independently on
	disjoint parts of the program, in an off-the-shelf manner.  At
	the boundaries between nested type checked and symbolically
	executed code regions, we use special mix rules to communicate
	information between the off-the-shelf systems.  The resulting
	mixture is a provably sound analysis that is more precise than
	type checking alone and more efficient than exclusive symbolic
	execution.  In addition, we also describe a prototype
	implementation, <fmt kind="tool">Mixy</fmt>, for C.  Mixy
	checks for potential null dereferences by mixing a
	null/non-null type qualifier inference system with a symbolic
	executor.</p>

	  Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods
	  that are worth optimizing: the "hot" methods. This paper
	  shows that four commonly-used Java profilers (xprof, hprof,
	  jprofile, and yourkit) often disagree on the identity of the
	  hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be
	  incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will
	  mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a
	  cold method with little or no performance improvement.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and
	  to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It
	  shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental
	  requirement for sampling-based profilers: to be correct, a
	  sampling-based profiler must collect samples randomly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects
	  samples randomly, does not suffer from the above
	  problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case
	  studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that
	  are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers
	  report that these methods are cold and thus not worth
	  optimizing.

	<p>The blame calculus of Wadler and Findler gives a high-level
	semantics to casts in higher-order languages. The coercion
	calculus of Henglein, on the other hand, provides an

	can we precisely characterize the relationship between the
	high and low-level semantics of casts? Towards answering both
	of these questions, we design a cast calculus that summarizes
	a sequence of casts as a threesome cast that contains a source
	type, a target type, and a third middle type that is the
	greatest lower bound of all the types in the sequence. We show
	that the threesome calculus is equivalent to the blame
	calculus and to one of the coercion-based, blame-tracking
	calculi of Siek, Garcia, and Taha. We also show that the
	threesome calculus is space efficient and obtain a tighter
	bound than that of Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>To improve the performance of transactional memory (TM),
	researchers have found many eager and lazy optimizations for
	conflict detection, the process of determining if transactions
	can commit. Despite these optimizations, nearly all TMs
	perform one aspect of lazy conflict detection in the same
	manner to preserve serializability. That is, they perform
	commit-time validation, where a transaction is checked for
	conflicts with previously committed transactions during its
	commit phase. While commit-time validation is efficient for
	workloads that exhibit limited contention, it can limit
	transaction throughput for contending workloads.

        This paper presents an efficient implementation of commit-time
        invalidation, a strategy where transactions resolve their
        conflicts with in-flight (uncommitted) transactions before
        they commit. Commit-time invalidation supplies the contention
        manager (CM) with data that is unavailable through commit-time
        validation, allowing the CM to make decisions that increase
        transaction throughput. Commit-time invalidation also requires
        notably fewer operations than commit-time validation for
        memory-intensive transactions, uses zero commit-time
        operations for dynamically detected read-only transactions,
        and guarantees full opacity for any transaction in O(N) time,
        an improvement over incremental validation's O(N2) time. Our
        experimental results show that for contending workloads, our
        efficient commit-time invalidating software TM (STM) is up to
        3 x faster than TL2, a state-of-the-art validating STM.</p>

	low-level aspects such as, pointers to fields and untagged
	unions.  Yet, higher-level representations that collect fields
	into records are often used because they are typically more
	convenient and efficient in modeling the program heap.  In
	this paper, we present a shape graph representation of memory
	that exposes individual fields while largely retaining the
	convenience of an object-level model.  This representation has
	a close connection to particular kinds of formulas in
	separation logic.  Then, with this representation, we show how
	to extend the <fmt kind="tool">Xisa</fmt> shape analyzer for
	low-level aspects, including pointers to fields, C-style
	nested structures and unions, malloc and free, and array
	values, with minimal changes to the core algorithms (e.g.,
	materialization and summarization).</p>

	<p>Memory bandwidth limits the performance of important
	kernels in many scientific applications. Such applications
	often use sequences of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
	(BLAS), and highly efficient implementations of those routines
	enable scientists to achieve high performance at little
	cost. However, tuning the BLAS in isolation misses
	opportunities for memory optimization that result from
	composing multiple subprograms. Because it is not practical to
	create a library of all BLAS combinations, we have developed a
	domain-specific compiler that generates them on demand. In
	this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for compiling linear
	algebra kernels and searching for the best combination of
	optimization choices. We also present a new hybrid
	analytic/empirical method for quickly evaluating the
	profitability of each optimization. We report experimental
	results showing speedups of up to 130% relative to the
	GotoBLAS on an AMD Opteron and up to 137% relative to MKL on
	an Intel Core 2.</p>
