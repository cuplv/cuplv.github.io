        <a href="https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/21053/"><b>Apply for a Tenure-Track Position in Trustworthy Software</b></a>.
        <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs">The Department of Computer Science</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder is currently seeking applications for a tenure-track faculty position in the area of secure and reliable software. This includes, but is not limited to, a broad swath of topics, including programming language foundations (e.g., type systems, language design), large-scale distributed systems (e.g., cloud computing), secure software (e.g., language-based security), probabilistic programming (e.g., languages for machine learning), automated reasoning (e.g., program analysis, software verification), industrial-scale computing (e.g., software engineering), and computing education research. However, many promising candidates may not identify their work under any of the specific areas listed. Such candidates are encouraged to contact the search chair (see below).</p>
        <p>The position is open at all levels, with emphasis on applicants at the Assistant Professor level. Candidates whose expertise cuts across engineering and related disciplines are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
        <p>We are especially interested in qualified candidates who can contribute, through their research, teaching, and service, to the diversity and excellence of our academic community. Our university is also responsive to dual career situations.</p>
        <p>This position is part of the long-term growth plans for the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS). CEAS is the highest ranked engineering college in the Rocky Mountain time zone and hosts several nationally ranked departments.  The Department of Computer Science has 2500 undergraduate students, 369 graduate students and 69 faculty.  The Department's research and education efforts interact broadly with many interdisciplinary programs and collaborators in the Boulder area, including national labs at NIST, NOAA, NREL, and NCAR, and CU Boulder research institutes including the ATLAS Institute, the BioFrontiers Institute, and the Institute for Cognitive Science.  More than 20 faculty members have joint affiliations with one of these labs. The Department also has a long-standing partnership with the National Center for Women and IT and has faculty active in increasing the broadening of participation in computer science via their research, teaching, and service. In addition, the Department has extensive ties with the thriving local tech community and inhabits a picturesque location in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
        <p>Candidates will be expected to engage in undergraduate and graduate teaching, contribute professional service, and develop vigorous, externally funded research programs in their technical areas. Potential faculty members applying to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder should describe their plans to develop a recognized research program based on scholarly work in their particular field, their ideas for interdisciplinary collaboration, their experience and interests in teaching undergraduates and graduates, and their future plans for inspiring diverse students to conduct research.</p>
        <p>The position will remain open until filled, though for full consideration applications should be received by December 1, 2019.</p>
        <p><a href="https://jobs.colorado.edu/jobs/JobDetail/21351/"><b>Apply for an Instructor Position</b></a>.
        The Department of Computer Science in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder invites applications for a full-time Instructor position. This position will support the Department of Computer Science and fulfillment of the department’s educational mission through teaching Computer Science courses on the CU-Boulder campus.</p>
        <p>Candidates must demonstrate a strong commitment to high-quality undergraduate education. We are particularly interested in candidates with a background in the areas of algorithms, databases, software engineering, or programming languages.</p>
        <p>Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.</p>

        <title>Compiler and Runtime Optimizations for GPU Memory Systems</title>
        <abstract>
          <p>In recent year, we have seen a rapid rise of massive parallelism in
          modern processors, exemplified by GPUs, APUs and MIC processors. The
          emergence of massive parallelism in a single node brings growing
          demands for efficient data accesses. Optimizing memory throughput is
          hence critical for tapping into the full potential of the many-core
          systems. In the first half of the talk, I will present some
          theoretical and empirical results on optimizing memory coalescing for
          GPUs. In the second half of the talk, I will present our framework to
          automatically place data on GPUs for performance and portability.</p>

          Beyond Requirements Falsification: Semi-Formal Methods and Tools for the Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems
        </title>
        <abstract>
          <p>Correct-by-design synthesis methods for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are still in their infancy for CPS with complex physical dynamics. For that reason, a combination of design theories for simpler systems and/or ad-hoc design approaches are
            utilized. Hence, numerous design and implementation errors are discovered while CPS are operational in the field. Such errors can have catastrophic effects to human life and to the economy. Over the last few years, requirements guided falsification
            methods have proven to be a practical approach to the verification problem of industrial size CPS. However, requirements falsification is just one component of the necessary tools for the development of safe and reliable CPS. In this talk, Fainekos
            will provide an overview of his team's research in providing support for all the stages of the development for CPS, from formal requirements elicitation and mining to system conformance to on-line monitoring. Most of their methods have been
            implemented in a Matlab (TM) toolbox called S-TaLiRo (System's TemporAl LogIc Robustness). Finally, in this talk, he will demonstrate that S-TaLiRo can provide answers to challenge problems from the automotive industry.</p>

  <title>Petablox: Declarative Program Analysis for Big Code</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Most software development today leverages the world's massive collection of open source software. There is significant room for program analyses to similarly leverage Big Code, the collective knowledge amassed from analyzing existing programs, to automatically infer or predict salient behaviors and vulnerabilities in new programs. We present Petablox, a framework for automatically synthesizing use-cases of arbitrary declarative program analyses for Big Code tasks such as efficiently finding good abstractions, transferring analysis results across programs, and adapting analyses to user feedback. Despite their diversity, all these tasks entail solving large instances of MaxSAT, the maximum satisfiability problem which comprises a mix of hard (inviolable, logical) constraints and soft (violable, probabilistic) constraints. We describe demand-driven, compositional, and learning-based MaxSAT optimizations in Petablox for scaling these tasks to large code bases.</p>

  <title>Flexible Goal-Directed Abstraction</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Static program analysis is a powerful technique for bug-finding, verification, and program understanding. Yet static analyses remain conspicuously absent from the toolbox of the average developer because they must abstract away details about concrete program behavior. Designing effective abstractions is tricky business: imprecise abstractions are inexpensive, but can be useless because they lose too much information about the program, whereas conventional wisdom states that precise abstractions are too expensive to scale.</p>
<p>This dissertation considers the problem of goal-directed static analysis, an intriguing domain where there is hope for defying the conventional wisdom about precise and scalable abstractions. In contrast to more traditional whole-program approaches that must apply precise abstractions to the entire program, goal-directed approaches have the potential to be much more tractable because they can focus the effort of the analysis on a single goal query.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental challenges in goal-directed analysis: (A) designing abstractions that are as flexible as possible so they can be specialized to the needs of the query and (B) using this flexibility wisely to achieve a better precision/scalability tradeoff in practice. This dissertation addresses these challenges by introducing goal-directed abstraction coarsening, a new approach to goal-directed analysis. Our approach works backward from the goal query using an abstraction that is as precise as possible by default, but can be coarsened in order to narrow the focus of the analysis and improve scalability. We meet Challenge A by introducing flexible coarsening-based techniques for store abstraction and control-flow abstraction. Our store abstraction precisely represents a small view of the store relevant to the query by combining a separation logic-based representation with a flow-insensitive points-to analysis. We present a general framework for flexible control-flow abstraction that allows the framework to coarsen the control-flow abstraction by jumping over irrelevant code. Finally, we meet Challenge B by presenting goal-directed analyses incorporating our flexible abstractions. Our analyses use programmers’ invariant-based reasoning and the structure of event-driven programs to recognize opportunities for coarsening that are likely to enhance scalability without losing precision. We have implemented these analyses and shown that they can achieve precise and scalable results for a variety of client analyses than cannot be handled effectively by previous techniques.</p>

    Decidable Subclasses of Multi-Mode Systems (Schedulability, Reachability, and Related Problems)
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Hybrid automata are a natural and expressive formalism to model systems that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. However, the applications of hybrid automata in analyzing cyber-physical systems have been rather limited due to undecidability of simple verification problems such as reachability. This drawback of hybrid automata has fueled the investigation of the so-called compositional methodology to design complex system by sequentially composing well-understood lower-level components. This methodology has, for example, been used in the context of the motion planning problem for mobile robots, where the task is to move a robot along a pre-specified trajectory with arbitrary precision by sequentially composing a set of well-studied simple motion primitives, such as “move left”, “move right” and “go straight”.  In this talk, we summarize some of our recent results related to efficient solution of motion planning problem for systems whose motion primitives are given as constant-rate vectors with uncertainties.</p>

with the flexibility of conventional development. It is also the first
practical synthesis tool based on abstraction refinement. Finally, it is
the first synthesis tool to support automated debugging of input
specifications. I will explain the main principles behind the tool and

  <title>MemInsight: Platform-Independent Memory Profiling for JavaScript</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>JavaScript programs tend to suffer from memory issues that can either hurt performance, or worse, make programs crash due to slow exhaustion of memory. We present a new memory profiling tool MemInsight for JavaScript applications, including web applications. MemInsight is platform independent: it employs source-code instrumentation to generate a trace of memory allocations and accesses, and it uses standard browser features to track precise information for DOM (document object model) objects. The information thus collected enables detailed, time-varying analysis of memory behavior, including that of DOM objects.
    </p>
    <p>We describe several client analyses built into MemInsight. For instance, it points out situations in which there may be a memory leak, and it reports opportunities for replacing dynamic allocation with stack allocation. MemInsight is extensible to custom analyses as well. Our experimental evaluation showed that our client analyses found interesting memory issues in several publicly available apps, and that MemInsight had reasonable overhead.

  <title>SAT-based Techniques for Reactive Synthesis</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Two-player games are a useful formalism for the synthesis of reactive
systems. The traditional approach to solving such games iteratively
computes the set of winning states for one of the players. This requires
keeping track of all discovered winning states and can lead to space
explosion even when using efficient symbolic representations.  I will
present a new game solving method that works by exploring a subset of
all possible concrete runs of the game and proving that these runs can
be generalised into a winning strategy on behalf of one of the players.
We use counterexample-guided backtracking search, inspired by the RaReQs
QBF solver, to identify a subset of runs  that are sufficient to
consider to solve the game. Our search procedure performs learning from
both players' failures, gradually shrinking winning regions for both
players.  In addition, it allows extracting compact winning/spoiling
strategies using interpolation procedures.  We evaluate our algorithm on
several families of benchmarks derived from real-world device driver
synthesis problems.  Our approach outperforms  state-of-the-art BDD
solvers on some families of benchmarks. We  demonstrated that our
strategy extraction procedure is efficient and introduces low overhead
on top of the main solver.

    Behavioral contracts and security
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>
    Behavioral contracts are a widely used specification tool for software components, which enrich interface information with logical assertions. The rigorous enforcement of contracts provides to programmers precise guarantees about a program's execution, and offers useful feedback for debugging upon contract violations. However, almost all of research on contracts focuses on contracts as a specification tool for partial correctness of programs and ignores another vital requirement of modern software; security.
    </p>
          <p>In this talk, I will demonstrate how contracts can specify and enforce security policies. Specifically, I will focus on two applications of contracts in capability-based security. First, I will describe Shill; a secure shell scripting language where contracts specify and enforce
policies about which OS resources scripts intend to use and how they use them. This way, Shill's contracts help script authors and users to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Second, I will present a contract system that complements the contract system of Shill by
describing and enforcing declarative policies for the flow of capabilities between components. This manner, components can specify not only what capabilities they require from their users, but also how they intend to share these capabilities with other components.

  <title>
    Stochastic Optimization of x86_64 Binaries
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>The optimization of short sequences of loop-free fixed-point x86_64 code sequences is an important problem in high-performance computing. Unfortunately, the competing constraints of transformation correctness and performance improvement often force even special purpose compilers to produce sub-optimal code. We show that by encoding these constraints as terms in a cost function, and using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to rapidly explore the space of all possible programs, we are able to generate aggressively optimized versions of a given target program. Beginning from binaries compiled by gcc -O0, we are able to produce provably correct code sequences that either match or outperform the code produced by gcc -O3, and in some cases expert hand-written assembly.</p>
          <p>Because most high-performance applications contain floating-point computations, we extend our technique to this domain and show a novel approach to trading full floating-point precision for further increases in performance. We demonstrate the ability to generate reduced precision implementations of Intel's handwritten C numerics library that are up to six times faster than the original code, and achieve end-to-end speedups of over 30% on a direct numeric simulation and a ray tracer. Because optimizations that contain floating-point computations are not amenable to formal verification using the state of the art, we present a technique for characterizing maximum error and providing strong evidence for correctness.</p>

    Validation and Parameter Discovery for Stochastic Computational Models from Behavioral Specifications
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>The success of high-performance computing has facilitated the rapid development of increasingly complex models of natural and engineered systems by biologists, physicists, chemists, and even financial engineers. While the development of such models requires considerable domain knowledge and arguably little knowledge of the science of computing itself, we survey a key problem in computational modeling that cuts across boundaries of scientific disciplines and motivates the development of new massively parallel high-performance algorithms: the validation and parameter discovery for stochastic computational models.</p>

    Getting Off the Monorail or: How Twitter Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Monads
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Twitter is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on
    the internet, with over 140 million active users and serving
    over 400 million Tweets per day. Historically, nearly all of
    Twitter's traffic has been served by a monolithic
    application written in Ruby on Rails, referred to internally
    as "the monorail." Although Twitter has seen remarkable
    growth in its six years of existence, scaling this
    monolithic architecture has proved to be both error-prone
    and expensive, not only in terms of computational
    efficiency, but in terms of developer efficiency as well.</p>
    <p>More recently, Twitter has begun the process of replacing
    the monorail with a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA),
    where the services are JVM processes--mostly written in
    Scala--that communicate with one-another asynchronously over
    a network connection. Naively written, asynchronous code is
    often both tedious to write and difficult to reason about;
    at Twitter, the asynchronous code implementing Scala
    services is both simple and beautiful, thanks in large part
    to an internally-developed, open-source library called
    Finagle.</p>
    <p>In this talk, I will attempt to explain how Finagle's
    strong grounding in programming language theory has
    facilitated this transition to an SOA, and how Scala's
    advanced features allow for a library as expressive as
    Finagle to have been written in the first place.</p>

    Finding Falsifications in Complex Cyber-Physical Systems
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine discretely evolving
    computational components with a continuously changing
    physical world. Examples of CPS include safety-critical
    systems that control airplanes, automobiles, power plants
    and implantable medical devices. Assuring the safety of
    these systems requires techniques that transcend the limited
    coverage provided by testing/simulation. Even though
    impressive progress has been achieved with symbolic formal
    verification techniques for linear systems, the verification
    of non-linear, industrial scale CPS designs remains a
    distant goal.</p> <p>In this talk, I present a simple yet
    effective approach to automatically searching for property
    violations in non-linear systems.  Our approach defines the
    notion of robustness metrics over traces that can be used to
    measure distances between simulation traces and properties
    expressed in temporal logics.  As a result, robustness
    metrics can naturally quantify how "close" a particular
    simulation of the system is to violating a property of
    interest.  By treating robustness metrics as an objective
    function to minimize over the simulation traces of the
    system, we can use many off-the-shelf global optimization
    techniques to effectively steer the simulations towards a
    falsification of the property being considered.</p>
    <p>Despite the lack of strong formal guarantees, we find
    that robustness-guided falsification is a promising approach
    to searching for property violations in complex systems.  We
    present the S-Taliro tool, an implementation of our approach
    to reason about properties of non-linear systems modeled as
    Simulink/Stateflow diagrams.  We present two interesting
    case studies using S-Taliro, including a risk analysis of
    insulin infusion pump usage by diabetic patients that models
    the software in the pump in conjunction with the dynamics of
    insulin/glucose regulatory system.</p>

  <abstract>
    <p>Program analyzes have been successful in finding serious
    program defects such as NULL pointer accesses or buffer
    overflows in programs written in C. However, industry relies
    heavily on object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++.
    This talk presents our recent advances in static analysis
    for C++. It focuses on C++ specific difficulties such as
    multiple inheritance, conversion from C++ strings to C
    strings and vice versa, and C++ exception semantics.</p>

    Probabilistic Approximation and Analysis Bio-pathways Dynamics
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>A system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is
    often used to model the dynamics of a bio-chemical
    network. Such systems are difficult to analyze. To get
    around this, we construct a discrete probabilistic
    approximation of the ODE dynamics as a dynamic Bayesian
    network.  Consequently, pathway properties can be analyzed
    using standard Bayesian inference techniques. Apart from
    testing our method on ODEs models drawn from the biomodels
    data base, we have used our technique in a combined
    computational and experimental study of the human complement
    system under inflammation conditions.  Our results are very
    encouraging in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we
    have extended the scalability of our approach via a GPU
    implementation.</p>

    Towards the Verification of Hybrid Data-Flow Languages
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Hybrid systems are used to model embedded computing
    systems interacting with their physical environment. There
    is a conceptual mismatch between high-level hybrid system
    languages, like Simulink, which are used for simulation, and
    hybrid automata, the most suitable representation for safety
    verification. Indeed, in simulation languages the
    interaction between discrete and continuous execution steps
    is specified using the concept of zero-crossings, whereas
    hybrid automata exploit the notion of staying conditions.
    In this talk we first briefly present Zelus, a synchronous
    data-flow language extended with ordinary differential
    equations.  Then we propose a sound translation from a
    Zelus-like hybrid data-flow formalism to logico-numerical
    hybrid automata discussing various zero-crossing semantics
    and the extent to which the original semantics is preserved.
    At last we sketch how existing continuous reachability
    analysis methods can be applied to logico-numerical hybrid
    automata.</p>

    The BDDAPRON Logico-Numerical Abstract Domain Library
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>We describe BDDAPRON, a freely available library
    dedicated to the static analysis of finite-type and
    numerical variables.</p>
    <p>BDDAPRON provides ready-to-use logico-numerical
    abstractions for combinations of finite-type and numerical
    variables, as well as powerful symbolic manipulations of
    expressions.</p>
    <p>Algorithmically, BDDAPRON combines BDD techniques (using
    the CUDD library) with numerical abstract domains provided

    What can the Garbage Collector compute efficiently? A
    Language for Heap Assertions at Garbage Collection Time
  </title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Finding bugs is among the most challenging tasks in
    software development.  For this reason, modern software
    development methodologies encourage programmers to use
    assertions throughout their code to express the assumptions
    they are making.  At runtime, these assertions then detect
    whenever the assumptions do not match the program; in other
    words, they detect bugs early.  However, traditional
    assertion mechanisms in mainstream languages such as C or
    Java are limited in their expressivity.</p>
    <p>This talk presents DeAL, a rich heap assertion language
    for Java that extends over the expressive power of
    traditional assertions.  DeAL introduces additional
    primitives to reason over heap layout, allowing programmers
    to assert global invariants, ownership, and other properties
    that would be impossible to express in traditional
    assertions.</p>
    <p>By design, all DeAL assertions require only a single heap
    traversal and can execute as part of garbage collection.
    Consequently, DeAL is not only expressive, but also ensures
    a very low execution overhead.</p>

  <title>Building Verified Software with Dependent Types</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Recent years have seen intensive interest among
    Programming Language (PL) researchers in connecting PL and
    Verification.  Static analyses which once were primarily
    intended for enabling optimizations in compilers are now
    used also for program verification and bug finding.  Type
    systems, which had been used to detect (either statically or
    dynamically) low-level bugs, are now pushed to express
    stronger and stronger semantic properties of code.  Arguably
    the most powerful such systems known are so-called dependent
    type systems, which combine programming and theorem proving,
    and use rich types to express general logical specifications
    of programs.</p>
    <p>In this talk, I will describe ongoing work in my group to
    design, prove, and implement dependently typed programming
    languages, and apply them for challenging case studies.  I
    will summarize the design of the Guru dependently typed
    programming language, and explain how it overcomes some
    traditional difficulties for dependently typed languages,
    concerning general recursion and also the treatment of
    equality.  For a case study, I will describe recent work of
    my doctoral student Duckki Oe to implement a statically
    verified modern SAT solver called versat in Guru. Versat
    uses the efficient low-level data structures and algorithms
    of modern solvers like Minisat, but has been statically
    verified to be sound: if versat reports "unsat", then the
    input formula is truly contradictory.  Versat can solve
    benchmarks on the modern scale, including some from the SAT
    Competition 2009.  I will conclude with a glimpse at a new
    dependently typed language called Trellys, being designed
    and implemented in a collaborative project with Stephanie
    Weirich at U. Pennsylvania and Tim Sheard at Portland
    State.</p>

  <title>Proving stabilisation of biological models</title>
  <abstract>
    I will describe an efficient procedure for proving
    stabilisation of biological systems when modeled as
    qualitative networks or genetic regulatory networks. For
    scalability, we use modular proof techniques, where
    state-space exploration is applied only locally to small
    pieces of the system rather than the entire system as a
    whole. Our procedure exploits the observation that, in
    practice, the form of modular proofs can be restricted to a
    very limited set.  Using our new procedure, we have solved a
    number of challenging published examples, including: a 3-D
    model of the mammalian epidermis; a model of metabolic
    networks operating in type-2 diabetes; a model of fate
    determination of vulval precursor cells in the C. elegans
    worm; and a model of pair-rule regulation during
    segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. Our results show many
    orders of magnitude speedup in cases where previous
    stabilization proving techniques were known to succeed, and
    new results in cases where tools had previously failed.

  <title>Symbolic Predictive Analysis for Concurrent Programs</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Multi-core and multi-processor systems are becoming
    increasingly popular. However, our ability to effectively
    harness the power of parallelism is predicated upon advances
    in tools and algorithms for verifying concurrent
    programs. Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to
    verify, and a key reason for this is the behavioral
    complexity resulting from the large number of interleavings
    of concurrent threads.</p>
    <p>In this talk, I will introduce a symbolic predictive
    analysis for runtime detection of concurrency errors, by
    monitoring and subsequently analyzing the execution traces
    of a program. In this analysis, we first derive a symbolic
    predictive model using the trace information collected at
    run time as well as the program source code. What this model
    captures are not just the given traces, but all possible
    interleavings of events of these traces. Then we use
    symbolic reasoning to check whether there are concurrency
    errors in any of these interleavings. This is done by
    capturing these interleavings and the error conditions using
    a set of first-order logic formulas, and then deciding the
    formulas using an off-the-shelf Satisfiability Modulo Theory
    (SMT) solver.</p>

  <title>The Astrée Analyzer: Proving the absence of runtime
  errors automatically</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Runtime errors in embedded softwares may have disastrous
    consequences, e.g. in transportation or energy production
    systems.</p>
    <p>The Astrée analyzer aims at proving the absence of
    runtime errors in C programs and was designed specifically
    for synchronous applications as found in fly-by-wire
    systems. The analysis process is conservative, that is, it
    may fail to establish the correctness of some safe programs,
    but it is sound, that is it will report any runtime error.</p>
    <p>Astrée performs Abstract Interpretation based static
    analysis, that is abstract execution, using families of
    predicates formed by abstract domains. Astrée relies on a
    library of numerical and symbolic abstract domains, which
    allow to capture salient properties of embedded softwares,
    so as to establish absence of runtime errors. The analysis
    process is fully automatic, and involves automatic
    parameterization of the abstract domains.</p>
    <p>We will present the underlying concepts of Astrée, and
    examplify the use of the analyzer on a few selected
    examples.</p>
    <p>The Astrée analyzer has allowed to prove the absence of
    runtime errors in industrial size avionics programs. As of
    today, Absint Angewandte Informatik provides commercial
    diffusion and support of Astrée.</p>

  <title>New methods for proving temporal properties of infinite-state systems</title>
  <abstract>
    I will describe some new methods of proving temporal
    properties of infinite-state programs.  Our approach takes
    advantage of the fact that linear-temporal properties can
    often be proved more efficiently using proof techniques
    usually associated with the branching-time logic CTL.  The
    caveat is that, in certain instances, nondeterminism in the
    system's transition relation can cause CTL methods to report
    counterexamples that are spurious in LTL. To address this
    problem we describe an algorithm that, as it attempts to
    apply CTL proof methods, finds and then removes problematic
    nondeterminism via an analysis on the spurious
    counterexamples. We must also develop CTL symbolic model
    checking tools for infinite-state systems.

  <title>How to Build Your Own Bidirectional Programming Language</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Most programs get used in just one direction, from input
    to output. But sometimes, having computed an output, we need
    to be able to update this output and then "calculate
    backwards" to find a correspondingly updated input. The
    problem of writing such bidirectional transformations --
    often called lenses -- arises in applications across a
    multitude of domains and has been attacked from many
    perspectives. Potential applications include synchronization
    of replicated data, system configuration management tools
    (such as RedHat's Augeas system), bidirectional
    transformations between software models, and updatable
    "security views."</p>
    <p>The Harmony project at the University of Pennsylvania is
    exploring a linguistic approach to bidirectional
    programming, designing domain-specific languages in which
    every expression simultaneously describes both parts of a
    lens. When read from left to right, an expression denotes an
    ordinary function that maps inputs to outputs. When read
    from right to left, it denotes an "update translator" that
    takes an input together with an updated output and produces
    a new input that reflects the update. These languages share
    some common elements with modern functional languages -- in
    particular, they come with very expressive type systems. In
    other respects, they are rather novel and surprising.</p>
    <p>We have designed, implemented, and applied bi-directional
    languages in three quite different domains: a language for
    bidirectional transformations on trees (such as XML
    documents), based on a collection of primitive bidirectional
    tree transformation operations and
    "bidirectionality-preserving" combining forms; a language
    for bidirectional views of relational data, using
    bidirectionalized versions of the operators of relational
    algebra as primitives; and, most recently, a language for
    bidirectional string transformations, with primitives based
    on standard notations for finite-state transduction and a
    type system based on regular expressions. The string case is
    especially interesting, both in its own right and because it
    exposes a number of foundational issues common to all
    bidirectional programming languages in a simple and familiar
    setting. We are also exploring how lenses and their types
    can be enriched to embody privacy and integrity policies.</p>
    <p>This talk explores the design of bidirectional languages,
    starting from the very simplest imaginable variant
    (bijective languages) and then developing several
    refinements.</p>

  <title>Towards a Science of Parallel Programming</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>When parallel programming started in the 70s and 80s, it
    was mostly art: languages such as functional and logic
    programming languages were designed and appreciated mainly
    for their elegance and beauty. More recently, parallel
    programming has become engineering: conventional languages
    like FORTRAN and C++ have been extended with constructs such
    as OpenMP, and we now spend our time benchmarking and
    tweaking large programs nobody understands to obtain
    performance improvements of 5-10%. In spite of all this
    activity, we have few insights into how to write parallel
    programs to exploit the performance potential of multicore
    processors.</p>
    <p>To break this impasse, we need a science of parallel
    programming. In this talk, I will introduce a concept called
    "amorphous data-parallelism" that provides a simple, unified
    picture of parallelism in a host of diverse applications
    ranging from mesh generation/refinement/partitioning to SAT
    solvers, maxflow algorithms, stencil computations, and
    event-driven simulation. Then I will present a natural
    classification that provides insight into the structure of
    parallelism and locality in these algorithms and into
    appropriate language and systems support for exploiting this
    parallelism.</p>

  <title>The Desktop: Frontiers in Systems Research</title>
  <host person="diwan"/>
  <abstract>
    Desktop software, in the form of web browsers, browser
    features, and OS distributions, are a growing area of
    engineering activity at Google. This talk will give an
    overview of this work, looking in detail at Native Client as
    an example project in the space. Native Client is an
    open-source research technology for running x86 native code
    in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the
    browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people
    expect from web apps. It supports performance-oriented
    features generally absent from web application programming
    environments, such as thread support, instruction set
    extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and
    hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open
    architecture designed to leverage existing web standards,
    and to encourage community review and third-party
    tools. Overall, Google's desktop efforts seek to enable new
    Web applications, improve end-user experience, and enable a
    more flexible balance between client and server
    computing. Google has open sourced many of our desktop
    efforts, in part to encourage collaboration and independent
    innovation.

  <title>Introducing the Sparse Polyhedral Framework</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Loops often dominate the execution time of
    applications. Various transformation frameworks have been
    developed to enable the automatic compile-time
    transformation of loops. Many of the existing models fit
    within the polyhedral framework and although they are quite
    powerful, they are restricted to compile-time
    transformations and loop bounds and memory accesses that are
    affine or can be approximated as affine.</p>
    <p>In this talk, I will present the Sparse Polyhedral
    Framework (SPF). The SPF builds on the polyhedral
    programming model, but is also capable of expressing and
    supporting the code generation for run-time reordering
    transformations implemented with inspector/executor
    strategies. I will then discuss the idea of abstractions for
    exposing transformation frameworks in performance programmer
    models.</p>

  <title>Algorithmic Program Synthesis with Partial Programs</title>
  <abstract>
    <p>Why hasn't Moore's Law revolutionize programming?  In
    model checking, cycles fuel bug discovery, improving code
    quality, but programmers still write programs with their
    bare hands.  In fact, their work has not changed much since
    the CRT terminal, except that they think in better
    languages.</p>
    <p>Program synthesis might be a way to reduce
    the programmer's cognitive load.  Synthesizers have derived
    programs that were highly efficient, and sometimes even
    surprising.  Of course, they had to be first "programmed"
    with the human insights about the domain at hand.</p>
    <p>Which brings us to a key problem in program synthesis ---
    how to communicate human expertise to the synthesizer.  In
    deductive synthesis, this expertise is captured in a domain
    theory.  Often elusive even to formally trained experts, a
    domain theory is probably not a shortcut to programmer
    productivity.</p> <p>This talk will describe a growing
    family of synthesizers based on partial programs.  Their
    premise is that programs can be decomposed into insight and
    mechanics: if the programmer encodes her insight as a
    partial program, the mechanics can then be synthesized given
    a specification.  Partial programs lend themselves to
    algorithmic synthesis: rather than deducing a program with a
    theorem prover, algorithmic synthesis finds the program in a
    space of candidate implementations described by the partial
    program.</p>
    <p>Among five synthesizers, I will describe an algorithm for
    finding a candidate by constraint solving, rather than via
    generate-and-test, and a system for programming with angelic
    non-determinism which computes the insight into a
    programming problem.</p>

        <p>We consider the problem of automatically proving resource bounds. That is, we study how to prove that an integer-valued resource variable is bounded by a given program expression. Automatic resource-bound analysis has recently received significant attention because of a number of important applications (e.g., detecting performance bugs, preventing algorithmic-complexity attacks, identifying side-channel vulnerabilities), where the focus has often been on developing precise amortized reasoning techniques to infer the most exact resource usage. While such innovations remain critical, we observe that fully precise amortization is not always necessary to prove a bound of interest. And in fact, by amortizing <em>selectively</em>, the needed supporting invariants can be simpler, making the invariant inference task more feasible and predictable. We present a framework for selectively-amortized analysis that mixes worst-case and amortized reasoning via a property decomposition and a program transformation. We show that proving bounds in any such decomposition yields a sound resource bound in the original program, and we give an algorithm for selecting a reasonable decomposition.</p>

        <p>We consider the problem of making expressive static analyzers interactive. Formal static analysis is seeing increasingly widespread adoption as a tool for verification and bug-finding, but even with powerful cloud infrastructure it can take minutes or hours to get batch analysis results after a code change. While existing techniques offer some demand-driven or incremental aspects for certain classes of analysis, the fundamental challenge we tackle is doing both for arbitrary abstract interpreters. </p>
        <p>Our technique, demanded abstract interpretation, lifts program syntax and analysis state to a dynamically evolving graph structure, in which program edits, client-issued queries, and evaluation of abstract semantics are all treated uniformly. The key difficulty addressed by our approach is the application of general incremental computation techniques to the complex, cyclic dependency structure induced by abstract interpretation of loops with widening operators. We prove that desirable abstract interpretation meta-properties, including soundness and termination, are preserved in our approach, and that demanded analysis results are equal to those computed by a batch abstract interpretation. Experimental results suggest promise for a prototype demanded abstract interpretation framework: by combining incremental and demand-driven techniques, our framework consistently delivers analysis results at interactive speeds, answering 95% of queries within 1.2 seconds.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>The computation of semantic information about the behavior of pointer-manipulating programs has been a long standing issue, attacked with diverse and numerous techniques and tools for over 50 years. As usual in automatic verification of infinite-state programs, properties of interest are not computable. Thus, static analyses can only be conservative, leading different analyses to make different tradeoffs between the intricacies of the properties they detect, the precision of their inference procedure and analysis, and the scalability of the analysis.</p>
        <p>In this context, shape analyses focus on inferring highly complex properties of heap-manipulating programs. These programs utilize data structures which are implemented using an unbounded number of dynamically- (heap-) allocated memory cells interconnected via mutable pointer-links. Because shape analyses have to reason about data structures whose size is not bounded by a fixed, known value, they cannot track explicitly the particular properties of every concrete memory cell which the program uses, as done, e.g., by analysis of variable-manipulating non-recursive programs. Instead, shape analyses summarize memory regions by letting one piece of abstract information, called summary predicate, describe several concrete cells. The need to cope with data structures of unbounded sizes is a challenge shape analyses share with static analyzers of array-manipulating programs. However, while the size of an array may change in different executions, its layout (i.e., its dimensions and the way its contents are spread over the memory) is fixed. In contrast, the layout of a pointer-linked data structure, colloquially referred to as its shape, may evolve dynamically during the program execution and a memory cell can be part of different data structures at different points in time. As a result, shape analyses need to let the denotation of summary predicates in terms of the constituents and layouts of the memory regions which they represent evolve during the analysis as well.</p>
        <p>In this survey, we consider that shape analyses are characterized and defined by the presence of summary predicates describing a set of concrete memory cells that varies during the course of the analysis. We use this characterization as a means for distinguishing shape analyses as a particular class of pointer analyses. We show that many “standard” pointer analyses do not fit the aforementioned description, while many analyses relying on very different mathematical foundations, e.g., shape graphs, three-valued logic, and separation logic, do.</p>
        <p>The ambition of this survey is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of shape analysis, and to present the foundation of this topic, in a single document that is accessible to readers who are not familiar with it. To do so, we characterize the essence of shape analysis compared to more classical pointer analyses. We supply the intuition underlying the abstractions commonly used in shape analysis and the algorithms that allow to statically compute intricate semantic properties. Then, we cover the main families of shape analysis abstraction and algorithms, highlight the similarities between them, and also characterize the main differences between the most common approaches. Last, we review a few other static analysis works (such as array abstractions, dictionary abstractions and interprocedural analyses) that were influenced by the ideas of shape analysis, so as to demonstrate the impact of the field.</p>

        <p>In this paper, we study efficient approaches to reachability analysis for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems when the dependencies among the variables of the system have low treewidth. Reachability analysis over nonlinear dynamical systems asks if a given set of target states can be reached starting from an initial set of states. This is solved by computing conservative over approximations of the reachable set using abstract domains to represent these approximations. However, most approaches must tradeoff the level of conservatism against the cost of performing analysis, especially when the number of system variables increases. This makes reachability analysis challenging for nonlinear systems with a large number of state variables. Our approach works by constructing a dependency graph among the variables of the system. The tree decomposition of this graph builds a tree wherein each node of the tree is labeled with subsets of the state-variables of the system. Furthermore, the tree decomposition satisfies important structural properties. Using the tree decomposition, our approach abstracts a set of states of the high dimensional system into a tree of sets of lower dimensional projections of this state. We derive various interesting properties of this abstract domain, including conditions under which the original high dimensional set can be fully recovered from its low dimensional projections. Next, we use ideas from message passing developed originally for belief propagation over Bayesian networks to perform reachability analysis over the full statespace in an efficient manner. We illustrate our approach on some interesting nonlinear systems with low treewidth to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</p>

        <p>In this paper, we propose a method for bounding the probability that a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system violates a safety specification over the infinite time horizon. SDEs are mathematical models of stochastic processes that capture how states evolve continuously in time. They are widely used in numerous applications such as engineered systems (e.g., modeling how pedestrians move in an intersection), computational finance (e.g., modeling stock option prices), and ecological processes (e.g., population change over time). Previously the safety verification problem has been tackled over finite and infinite time horizons using a diverse set of approaches. The approach in this paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time bound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a negligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier certificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of safety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a finite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation over this interval. We demonstrate our approach over a collection of interesting examples from the literature, wherein our approach can be used to find tight bounds on the violation probability of safety properties over the infinite time horizon.</p>

        <p>Reachability analysis is a critical tool for the formal verification of dynamical systems and the synthesis of controllers for them. Due to their computational complexity, many reachability analysis methods are restricted to systems with relatively small dimensions. One significant reason for such limitation is that those approaches, and their implementations, are not designed to leverage parallelism. They use algorithms that are designed to run serially within one compute unit and they can not utilize widely-available high-performance computing (HPC) platforms such as many-core CPUs, GPUs and Cloud-computing services. This paper presents PIRK, a tool to efficiently compute reachable sets for general nonlinear systems of extremely high dimensions. PIRK can utilize HPC platforms for computing reachable sets for general high-dimensional non-linear systems. PIRK has been tested on several systems, with state dimensions up to 4 billion. The scalability of PIRK’s parallel implementations is found to be highly favorable.</p>

        <p>Large-scale stochastic systems have recently received significant attentions due to their broad applications in various safety-critical systems such as traffic networks and self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a software tool, called AMYTISS, implemented in C++/OpenCL, for designing correct-by-construction controllers for large-scale discrete-time stochastic systems. This tool is employed to (i) build finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) as finite abstractions of given original systems, and (ii) synthesize controllers for the constructed finite MDPs satisfying bounded-time safety and reach-avoid specifications. In AMYTISS, scalable parallel algorithms are designed such that they support parallel execution within CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators (HWAs). Unlike all existing tools for stochastic systems, AMYTISS can utilize high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and cloud-computing services to mitigate the effects of the state-explosion problem, which is always present in analyzing large-scale stochastic systems. We benchmark AMYTISS against the most recent tools in the literature using several physical case studies including robot examples, room temperature and road traffic networks. We also apply our algorithms to a 3-dimensional autonomous vehicle and 7-dimensional nonlinear model of a BMW 320i car by synthesizing an autonomous parking controller.</p>

        <p>Static analysis tools for JavaScript must strike a delicate balance, achieving the level of precision required by the most complex features of target programs without incurring prohibitively high analysis time. For example, reasoning about dynamic property accesses sometimes requires precise relational information connecting the object, the dynamically-computed property name, and the property value. Even a minor precision loss at such critical program locations can result in a proliferation of spurious dataflow that renders the analysis results useless.</p>
        <p>We present a technique by which a conventional non-relational static dataflow analysis can be combined soundly with a value refinement mechanism to increase precision on demand at critical locations. Crucially, our technique is able to incorporate relational information from the value refinement mechanism into the non-relational domain of the dataflow analysis.</p>
        <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by extending an existing JavaScript static analysis with a demand-driven value refinement mechanism that relies on backwards abstract interpretation. Our evaluation finds that precise analysis of widely used JavaScript utility libraries depends heavily on the precision at a small number of critical locations that can be identified heuristically, and that backwards abstract interpretation is an effective mechanism to provide that precision on demand.</p>

        Developing interactive applications (apps) against event-driven software frameworks such as Android is notoriously difficult. To create apps that behave as expected, developers must follow complex and often implicit asynchronous programming protocols. Such protocols intertwine the proper registering of callbacks to receive control from the framework with appropriate application-programming interface (API) calls that in turn affect the set of possible future callbacks. An app violates the protocol when, for example, it calls a particular API method in a state of the framework where such a call is invalid. What makes automated reasoning hard in this domain is largely what makes programming apps against such frameworks hard: the specification of the protocol is unclear, and the control flow is complex, asynchronous, and higher-order. In this paper, we tackle the problem of specifying and modeling event-driven application-programming protocols. In particular, we formalize a core meta-model that captures the dialogue between event-driven frameworks and application callbacks. Based on this meta-model, we define a language called lifestate that permits precise and formal descriptions of application-programming protocols and the callback control ﬂow imposed by the event-driven framework. Lifestate uniﬁes modeling what app callbacks can expect of the framework with specifying rules the app must respect when calling into the framework. In this way, we eﬀectively combine lifecycle constraints and typestate rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of lifestate modeling, we provide a dynamic verification algorithm that takes as input a trace of execution of an app and a lifestate protocol specification to either produce a trace witnessing a protocol violation or a proof that no such trace is realizable.

        Our aim is to statically verify that in a given reactive program, the length of collection variables does not grow beyond a given bound. We propose a scalable type-based technique that checks that each collection variable has a given refinement type that specifies constraints about its length. A novel feature of our refinement types is that the refinements can refer to AST counters that track how many times an AST node has been executed. This feature enables type refinements to track limited flow-sensitive information. We generate verification conditions that ensure that the AST counters are used consistently, and that the types imply the given bound. The verification conditions are discharged by an off-the-shelf SMT solver. Experimental results demonstrate that our technique is scalable, and effective at verifying reactive programs with respect to requirements on length of collections.

        <p>We investigate the problem of mining graph-based usage patterns for large, object-oriented frameworks like Android-revisiting previous approaches based on graph-based object usage models (groums). Groums are a promising approach to represent usage patterns for object-oriented libraries because they simultaneously describe control flow and data dependencies between methods of multiple interacting object types. However, this expressivity comes at a cost: mining groums requires solving a subgraph isomorphism problem that is well known to be expensive. This cost limits the applicability of groum mining to large API frameworks. In this paper, we employ groum mining to learn usage patterns for object-oriented frameworks from program corpora. The central challenge is to scale groum mining so that it is sensitive to usages horizontally across programs from arbitrarily many developers (as opposed to simply usages vertically within the program of a single developer). To address this challenge, we develop a novel groum mining algorithm that scales on a large corpus of programs. We first use frequent itemset mining to restrict the search for groums to smaller subsets of methods in the given corpus. Then, we pose the subgraph isomorphism as a SAT problem and apply efficient pre-processing algorithms to rule out fruitless comparisons ahead of time. Finally, we identify containment relationships between clusters of groums to characterize popular usage patterns in the corpus (as well as classify less popular patterns as possible anomalies). We find that our approach scales on a corpus of over five hundred open source Android applications, effectively mining obligatory and best-practice usage patterns.</p>

        <p>Event-driven programming frameworks, such as Android, are based on components with asynchronous interfaces. The protocols for interacting with these components can often be described by finite-state machines we dub callback typestates. Callback typestates are akin to classical typestates, with the difference that their outputs (callbacks) are produced asynchronously. While useful, these specifications are not commonly available, because writing them is difficult and error-prone.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to make the task of producing callback typestates significantly easier. We present a callback typestate assistant tool, DroidStar, that requires only limited user interaction to produce a callback typestate. Our approach is based on an active learning algorithm, L*. We improved the scalability of equivalence queries (a key component of L*), thus making active learning tractable on the Android system.</p>
        <p>We use DroidStar to learn callback typestates for Android classes both for cases where one is already provided by the documentation, and for cases where the documentation is unclear. The results show that DROIDSTAR learns callback typestates accurately and efficiently. Moreover, in several cases, the synthesized callback typestates uncovered surprising and undocumented behaviors.</p>

        <p>Differential performance debugging is a technique to find performance
        problems. It applies in situations where the performance of a program is
        (unexpectedly) different for different classes of inputs. The task is to
        explain the differences in asymptotic performance among various input
        classes in terms of program internals. We propose a data-driven
        technique based on <em>discriminant regression tree</em> (DRT) learning
        problem where the goal is to discriminate among different classes of
        inputs. We propose a new algorithm for DRT learning that first clusters
        the data into functional clusters, capturing different asymptotic
        performance classes, and then invokes off-the-shelf decision tree
        learning algorithms to explain these clusters. We focus on linear
        functional clusters and adapt classical clustering algorithms
        (<em>K</em>-means and spectral) to produce them. For the
        <em>K</em>-means algorithm, we generalize the notion of the cluster
        centroid from a point to a linear function. We adapt spectral clustering
        by defining a novel kernel function to capture the notion of "linear"
        similarity between two data points. We evaluate our approach on
        benchmarks consisting of Java programs where we are interested in
        debugging performance. We show that our algorithm significantly
        outperforms other well-known regression tree learning algorithms in
        terms of running time and accuracy of classification.</p>

        systems where sufficiently exercising the app with user-interaction (UI)
        event sequences to expose defects is both hard and time-consuming. In
        particular, there is a fundamental tension between brute-force random UI
        exercising tools, which are fully-automated but offer low relevance, and UI
        test scripts, which are manual but offer high relevance. In this paper, we
        consider a middle way---enabling a seamless fusion of scripted and randomized
        UI testing. This fusion is prototyped in a testing tool called ChimpCheck for
        programming, generating, and executing property-based randomized test cases
        for Android apps. Our approach realizes this fusion by offering a high-level,
        embedded domain-specific language for defining custom generators of simulated
        user-interaction event sequences. What follows is a combinator library built
        on industrial strength frameworks for property-based testing (ScalaCheck) and
        Android testing (Android JUnit and Espresso) to implement property-based
        randomized testing for Android development. Driven by real, reported issues
        in open source Android apps, we show, through case studies, how ChimpCheck
        enables expressing effective testing patterns in a compact manner.</p>

        <p>We present a technique for learning control Lyapunov (potential) functions, which are used in turn to synthesize controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems. The learning framework uses a <em>demonstrator</em> that implements a black-box, untrusted strategy presumed to solve the problem of interest, a <em>learner</em> that poses finitely many queries to the demonstrator to infer a candidate function and a <em>verifier</em> that checks whether the current candidate is a valid control Lyapunov function. The overall learning framework is iterative, eliminating a set of candidates on each iteration using the counterexamples discovered by the verifier and the demonstrations over these counterexamples. We prove its convergence using ellipsoidal approximation techniques from convex optimization. We also implement this scheme using nonlinear MPC controllers to serve as demonstrators for a set of state and trajectory stabilization problems for nonlinear dynamical systems. Our approach is able to synthesize relatively simple polynomial control Lyapunov functions, and in that process replace the MPC using a guaranteed and computationally less expensive controller.</p>

  <p>Software-defined networking (SDN) programs must simultaneously describe static forwarding behavior and dynamic updates in response to events. Event-driven updates are critical to get right, but difficult to implement correctly due to the high degree of concurrency in networks. Existing SDN platforms offer weak guarantees that can break application invariants, leading to problems such as dropped packets, degraded performance, security violations, etc. This paper introduces EVENT-DRIVEN CONSISTENT UPDATES that are guaranteed to preserve well-defined behaviors when transitioning between configurations in response to events. We propose NETWORK EVENT STRUCTURES (NESs) to model constraints on updates, such as which events can be enabled simultaneously and causal dependencies between events. We define an extension of the NetKAT language with mutable state, give semantics to stateful programs using NESs, and discuss provably-correct strategies for implementing NESs in SDNs. Finally, we evaluate our approach empirically, demonstrating that it gives well-defined consistency guarantees while avoiding expensive synchronization and packet buffering.</p>

  <p>We study the problem of falsifying reachability properties of real-time control software acting in a closed-loop with a given model of the plant dynamics. Our approach employs numerical techniques to simulate a plant model, which may be highly nonlinear and hybrid, in combination with symbolic simulation of the controller software. The state-space and input-space of the plant are systematically searched using a plant abstraction that is implicitly defined by "quantization" of the plant state, but never explicitly constructed. Simultaneously, the controller behaviors are explored using a symbolic execution of the control software. On-the-fly exploration of the overall closed-loop abstraction results in abstract counterexamples, which are used to refine the plant abstraction iteratively until a concrete violation is found. Empirical evaluation of our approach shows its promise in treating controller software that has precise, formal semantics, using an exact method such as symbolic execution, while using numerical simulations to produce abstractions of the underlying plant model that is often an approximation of the actual plant. We also discuss a preliminary comparison of our approach with techniques that are primarily simulation-based.</p>

  <p>We consider the problem of reasoning about the probability of assertion violations in straight-line, nonlinear computations involving uncertain quantities modeled as random variables. Such computations are quite common in many areas such as cyber-physical systems and numerical computation. Our approach extends probabilistic affine forms, an interval-based calculus for precisely tracking how the distribution of a given program variable depends on uncertain inputs modeled as noise symbols. We extend probabilistic affine forms using the precise tracking of dependencies between noise symbols combined with the expectations and higher order moments of the noise symbols. Next, we show how to prove bounds on the probabilities that program variables take on specific values by using concentration of measure inequalities. Thus, we enable a new approach to this problem that explicitly avoids subdividing the domain of inputs, as is commonly done in the related work. We illustrate the approach in this paper on a variety of challenging benchmark examples, and thus study its applicability to uncertainty propagation.</p>

  <p>Martingale theory yields a powerful set of tools that have recently been used to prove quantitative properties of stochastic systems such as stochastic safety and qualitative properties such as almost sure termination. In this paper, we examine proof techniques for establishing almost sure persistence and recurrence properties of infinite-state discrete time stochastic systems. A persistence property FG(P) specifies that almost all executions of the stochastic system eventually reach P and stay there forever. Likewise, a recurrence property GF(Q) specifies that a target set Q is visited infinitely often by almost all executions of the stochastic system. Our approach extends classic ideas on the use of Lyapunov-like functions to establish persistence and recurrence properties. Next, we extend known constraint-based invariant synthesis techniques to deduce the necessary supermartingale expressions to partly mechanize such proofs. We illustrate our techniques on a set of interesting examples.</p>

        <p>When constructing complex program analyses, it is often useful to
        reason about not just individual values, but collections of values.
        Symbolic set abstractions provide building blocks that can be used to
        partition elements, relate partitions to other partitions, and determine
        the provenance of multiple values, all without knowing any concrete
        values. To address the simultaneous challenges of scalability and
        precision, we formalize and implement an interface for symbolic set
        abstractions and construct multiple abstract domains relying on both
        specialized data structures and off-the-shelf theorem provers. We
        develop techniques for lifting existing domains to improve performance
        and precision. We evaluate these domains on real-world data structure

  <p>We present <em>jumping</em>, a form of selective control-flow abstraction useful for improving the scalability of goal-directed static analyses. Jumping is useful for analyzing programs with complex control-flow such as <em>event-driven</em> systems. In such systems, accounting for orderings between certain events is important for precision, yet analyzing the product graph of all possible event orderings is intractable. Jumping solves this problem by allowing the analysis to selectively abstract away control-flow between events irrelevant to a goal query while preserving information about the ordering of relevant events. We present a framework for designing sound jumping analyses and create an instantiation of the framework for performing precise inter-event analysis of Android applications. Our experimental evaluation showed that using jumping to augment a precise goal-directed analysis with inter-event reasoning enabled our analysis to prove 90--97\% of dereferences safe across our benchmarks.</p>

  <p>Over the past thirty years, there has been significant progress in developing general-purpose, language-based approaches to incremental computation, which aims to efficiently update the result of a computation when an input is changed. A key design challenge in such approaches is how to provide efficient incremental support for a broad range of programs. In this paper, we argue that first-class names are a critical linguistic feature for efficient incremental computation. Names identify computations to be reused across differing runs of a program, and making them first class gives programmers a high level of control over reuse. We demonstrate the benefits of names by presenting Nominal Adapton, an ML-like language for incremental computation with names. We describe how to use Nominal Adapton to efficiently incrementalize several standard programming patterns—including maps, folds, and unfolds—and show how to build efficient, incremental probabilistic trees and tries. Since Nominal Adapton's implementation is subtle, we formalize it as a core calculus and prove it is from-scratch consistent, meaning it always produces the same answer as simply re-running the computation. Finally, we demonstrate that Nominal Adapton can provide large speedups over both from-scratch computation and Adapton, a previous state-of-the-art incremental computation system.</p>

      <abstract>
    <p>Shape analysis aims to infer precise structural properties of
  imperative memory states and has been applied heavily to verify
  safety properties on imperative code over pointer-based data
  structures. Recent advances in shape analysis based on separation
  logic has leveraged summarization predicates that describe unbounded
  heap regions like lists or trees using inductive
  definitions. Unfortunately, data structures with <em>unstructured
    sharing</em>, such as graphs, are challenging to describe and reason
  about in such frameworks.
  In particular, when the sharing is unstructured, it cannot be described
  inductively in a local manner.
  In this paper, we propose a global
  abstraction of sharing based on set-valued variables that when
  integrated with inductive definitions enables the specification and
  shape analysis of structures with unstructured sharing.</p>

  <p>We present an approach and tool for general-purpose modeling of Android for static analysis.  Our approach is to explicate the reflective bridge between the Android framework and an application to make the framework source amenable to static analysis.  Our Droidel tool does this by automatically generating application-specific stubs that summarize the reflective behavior for a particular app.  The result is a program with a single entry-point that can be processed by any existing Java analysis platform (e.g., Soot, WALA, Chord).  We compared call graphs constructed using Droidel to call graphs constructed using a state-of-the-art Android model and found that Droidel captures more concrete behaviors.

  <p>Software-defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing the networking
industry, but current SDN programming platforms do not
provide automated mechanisms for updating global configurations
on the fly. Implementing updates by hand is challenging for SDN
programmers because networks are distributed systems with hundreds
or thousands of interacting nodes. Even if initial and final
configurations are correct, naively updating individual nodes can
lead to incorrect transient behaviors, including loops, black holes,
and access control violations. This paper presents an approach for
automatically synthesizing updates that are guaranteed to preserve
specified properties. We formalize network updates as a distributed
programming problem and develop a synthesis algorithm based on
counterexample-guided search and incremental model checking.
We describe a prototype implementation, and present results from
experiments on real-world topologies and properties demonstrating
that our tool scales to updates involving over one-thousand nodes.</p>

  <p>Dynamic language library developers face a challenging problem:
  ensuring that their libraries will behave correctly for a wide variety
  of client programs without having access to those client programs. This
  problem stems from the common use of two defining features for dynamic
  languages: callbacks into client code and complex manipulation of
  attribute names within objects. To remedy this problem, we introduce two
  state-spanning abstractions. To analyze callbacks, the first abstraction
  desynchronizes a heap, allowing partitions of the heap that may be
  affected by a callback to an unknown function to be frozen in the state
  prior to the call. To analyze object attribute manipulation, building
  upon an abstraction for dynamic language heaps, the second abstraction
  tracks attribute name/value pairs across the execution of a library. We
  implement these abstractions and use them to verify modular
  specifications of class-, trait-, and mixin-implementing libraries.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>This paper presents a controller synthesis approach using disjunctive polyhedral abstract interpretation. Our approach synthesizes infinite time-horizon controllers for safety properties with discrete-time, linear plant model and a switching feedback controller that is suitable for time-triggered implementations. The core idea behind our approach is to perform an abstract interpretation over disjunctions of convex polyhedra to identify states that are potentially uncontrollable. Complementing this set yields the set of controllable states, starting from which, the safety property can be guaranteed by an appropriate control function. Since, a straightforward disjunctive domain is computationally inefficient, we present an abstract domain based on a state partitioning scheme that allows us to efficiently control the complexity of the intermediate representations. Next, we focus on the automatic generation of controller implementation from our final fixed point. We show that a balanced tree approach can yield efficient controller code with guarantees on the worst-case execution time of the controller. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a suite of benchmarks, comparing different instantiations with related synthesis tools. Our evaluation shows that our approach can successfully synthesize controller implementations for small to medium sized benchmarks.</p>

  <p>In this paper, we present an approach for finding violations of safety properties of hybrid systems. Existing approaches search for complete system trajectories that begin from an initial state and reach some unsafe state. We present an approach that searches over segmented trajectories, consisting of a sequence of segments starting from any system state. Adjacent segments may have gaps, which our approach then seeks to narrow iteratively. We show that segmented trajectories are actually paths in the abstract state graph obtained by tiling the state space with cells. Instead of creating the prohibitively large abstract state graph explicitly, our approach implicitly performs a randomized search on it using a {em scatter-and-simulate} technique. This involves repeated simulations, graph search to find likeliest abstract counterexamples, and iterative refinement of the abstract state graph. Finally, we demonstrate our technique on a number of case studies ranging from academic examples to models of industrial-scale control systems.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>In dynamic languages, objects are <em>open</em>&emdash;they support iteration over and dynamic addition/deletion of their attributes. Open objects, because they have an unbounded number of attributes, are difficult to abstract without a priori knowledge of all or nearly all of the attributes and thus pose a significant challenge for precise static analysis. To address this challenge, we present the HOO (Heap with Open Objects) abstraction that can precisely represent and infer properties about open-object-manipulating programs without any knowledge of specific attributes.  It achieves this by building upon a relational abstract domain for sets that is used to reason about partitions of object attributes.  An implementation of the resulting static analysis is used to verify specifications for dynamic language framework code that makes extensive use of open objects, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.</p>

  <p>The breadth and depth of heap properties that can be inferred by the union of today's shape analyses is quite astounding.  Yet, achieving scalability while supporting a wide range of complex data structures in a generic way remains a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we propose a way to side-step this issue by defining a generic abstract domain combinator for combining memory abstractions on disjoint regions. In essence, our abstract domain construction is to the separating conjunction in separation logic as the reduced product construction is to classical, non-separating conjunction. This approach eases the design of the analysis as memory abstract domains can be re-used by applying our separating conjunction domain combinator. And more importantly, this combinator enables an analysis designer to easily create a combined domain that applies computationally-expensive abstract domains only where it is required.</p>

As a library, it is useful for inferring relational data invariants in programs that manipulate data structures.  As a testbed, it allows easy extension of widening and join heuristics, enabling adaptations to new and varied applications.  In this paper we present the architecture of the library, guidelines on how to select heuristics, and an example instantiation of the library using the Apron library to verify set-manipulating programs.</p>

  <p>We present a generic analysis approach to the <em>imperative
  relationship update problem</em>, in which destructive updates
  temporarily violate a global invariant of interest. Such invariants can
  be conveniently and concisely specified with dependent refinement types,
  which are efficient to check flow-insensitively. Unfortunately, while
  traditional flow-insensitive type checking is fast, it is inapplicable
  when the desired invariants can be temporarily broken. To overcome this
  limitation, past works have directly ratcheted up the complexity of the
  type analysis and associated type invariants, leading to inefficient
  analysis and verbose specifications. In contrast, we propose a
  <em>generic lifting</em> of modular refinement type analyses with a
  symbolic analysis to efficiently and effectively check concise
  invariants that hold <em>almost everywhere</em>. The result is an
  efficient, highly modular flow-insensitive type analysis to
  <em>optimistically</em> check the preservation of global relationship
  invariants that can fall back to a precise, disjunctive symbolic
  analysis when the optimistic assumption is violated. This technique
  permits programmers to temporarily break and then re-establish
  relationship invariants&emdash;a flexibility that is crucial for
  checking relationships in real-world, imperative languages. A
  significant challenge is selectively violating the global type
  consistency invariant over heap locations, which we achieve via
  <em>almost type-consistent heaps</em>. To evaluate our approach, we have
  encoded the problem of verifying the safety of reflective method calls
  in dynamic languages as a refinement type checking problem. Our analysis
  is capable of validating reflective call safety at interactive speeds on
  commonly-used Objective-C libraries and applications.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>Precise heap reachability information is a prerequisite for many
  static verification clients. However, the typical scenario is that
  the available heap information, computed by say an up-front
  points-to analysis, is not precise enough for the client of
  interest. This imprecise heap information in turn leads to a deluge
  of false alarms for the tool user to triage. Our position is to
  approach the false alarm problem not just by improving the up-front
  analysis but by also employing after-the-fact, goal-directed
  <em>refutation analyses</em> that yield targeted precision
  improvements. We have investigated refutation analysis in the
  context of detecting statically a class of Android memory leaks. For
  this client, we have found the necessity for an overall analysis
  capable of path-sensitive reasoning interprocedurally and with
  strong updates---a level of precision difficult to achieve globally
  in an up-front manner. Instead, our approach uses a
  refutation analysis that mixes highly precise, goal-directed
  reasoning with facts derived from the up-front analysis
  to prove alarms false and thus enabling effective and sound
  filtering of the overall list of alarms.</p>

  <p>The aim of static analysis is to infer invariants about programs that are precise enough to establish semantic properties, such as the absence of run-time errors. Broadly speaking, there are two major branches of static analysis for imperative programs.  Pointer and <em>shape</em> analyses focus on inferring properties of pointers, dynamically-allocated memory, and recursive data structures, while <em>numeric</em> analyses seek to derive invariants on numeric values. Although simultaneous inference of shape-numeric invariants is often needed, this case is especially challenging and is not particularly well explored.  Notably, simultaneous shape-numeric inference raises complex issues in the design of the static analyzer itself.
In this paper, we study the construction of such shape-numeric, static analyzers. We set up an abstract interpretation framework that allows us to reason about simultaneous shape-numeric properties by combining shape and numeric abstractions into a modular, expressive abstract domain.  Such a modular structure is highly desirable to make its formalization and implementation easier to do and get correct. To achieve this, we choose a concrete semantics that can be abstracted step-by-step, while preserving a high level of expressiveness.  The structure of abstract operations (i.e., transfer, join, and comparison) follows the structure of this semantics.  The advantage of this construction is to divide the analyzer in modules and functors that implement abstractions of distinct features.</p>

  <p>We present techniques for the analysis of infinite state
  probabilistic programs to synthesize probabilistic invariants and prove
  almost-sure termination. Our analysis is based on the notion of (super)
  martingales from probability theory. First, we define the concept of
  (super) martingales for loops in probabilistic programs. Next, we
  present the use of concentration of measure inequalities to bound the
  values of martingales with high probability. This directly allows us to
  infer probabilistic bounds on assertions involving the program
  variables. Next, we present the notion of a super martingale ranking
  function (SMRF) to prove almost sure termination of probabilistic
  programs. Finally, we extend constraint-based techniques to synthesize
  martingales and super-martingale ranking functions for probabilistic
  programs. We present some applications of our approach to reason about
  invariance and termination of small but complex probabilistic programs.</p>

  for automatically inferring <em>relations</em> between the set of values
  stored in these containers. Relations include inclusion relations over
  unions and intersections, as well as quantified relationships with
  scalar variables. We develop an abstract domain constructor that builds
  a container domain out of a
  <em>Quantified Union-Intersection Constraint</em> (QUIC) graph
  parameterized by an arbitrary <em>base domain</em>.  We instantiate
  our domain with a polyhedral base domain and evaluate it on
  programs extracted from the Python test suite.  Over traditional,
  non-relational domains, we find significant precision improvements
  with minimal performance cost.</p>

    <p>We present a precise, path-sensitive static analysis for reasoning about
    <em>heap reachability</em>; that is, whether an object can be reached
    from another variable or object via pointer dereferences. Precise
    reachability information is useful for a number of clients, including
    static detection of a class of Android memory leaks. For this client,
    we found that the heap reachability information computed by a
    state-of-the-art points-to analysis was too imprecise, leading to
    numerous false-positive leak reports. Our analysis combines a symbolic
    execution capable of path-sensitivity and strong updates with abstract
    heap information computed by an initial flow-insensitive points-to
    analysis. This novel <em>mixed</em> representation allows us to
    achieve both precision and scalability by leveraging the pre-computed
    points-to facts to guide execution and prune infeasible paths. We have
    evaluated our techniques in the <span style="font-variant:
    small-caps">Thresher</span> tool, which we used to find several
    developer-confirmed leaks in Android applications.</p>

  <p>We propose an approach for the static analysis of probabilistic
  programs that sense, manipulate, and control based on uncertain
  data. Examples include programs used in risk analysis, medical
  decision making and cyber-physical systems. Correctness properties
  of such programs take the form of <em>queries</em> that seek the
  probabilities of assertions over program variables.  We present a
  static analysis approach that provides guaranteed interval bounds on
  the values (assertion probabilities) of such queries.  First, we
  observe that for probabilistic programs, it is possible to conclude
  facts about the behavior of the entire program by choosing a finite,
  <em>adequate set</em> of its paths. We provide strategies for choosing
  such a set of paths and verifying its adequacy.  The queries are
  evaluated over each path by a combination of symbolic execution and
  probabilistic volume-bound computations. Each path yields interval
  bounds that can be summed up with a "coverage"  bound to yield an
  interval that encloses the probability of assertion for the program
  as a whole.  We demonstrate promising results on a suite of
  benchmarks from many different sources including robotic
  manipulators and medical decision making programs.</p>

  <p>Fixed point digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a
  wide variety of digital processing and control systems. Common errors
        in fixed point filters include arithmetic round-off (truncation) errors,
  overflows and the presence of limit cycles. These errors can potentially
  compromise the correctness of the system as a whole. Traditionally digital
  filters have been verified using a combination of design techniques from control
  theory and extensive testing. In this paper, we examine the use of formal
  verification techniques as part of the design flow for fixed point digital
  filters. We study two classes of verification techniques involving bit-precise
  analysis and real-valued error approximations, respectively. We empirically
  evaluate several variants of these two fundamental approaches for verifying
  fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We design our comparison to
  reveal the best possible approach towards verifying real-world designs of
  infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. Our study compares the
  strengths and weaknesses of different verification techniques for digital
  filters and suggests efficient approaches using modern
  satisfiability-modulo-theories solvers (SMT) and hardware model checkers. This
  manuscript extends our previous work evaluating bounded verification, where a
  limited number of iterations of the system are explored, with unbounded
  verification, where an unlimited number of iterations of the system are
  considered. Doing so allows us to evaluate techniques that can prove the
  correctness of fixed point digital filter implementations.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>Real-world data structures are often enhanced with additional
  pointers capturing alternative paths through a basic inductive skeleton
        (e.g., back pointers, head pointers). From the static analysis point of view,
  we must obtain several interlocking shape invariants. At the same time, it is
  well understood in abstract interpretation design that supporting a separation
  of concerns is critically important to designing powerful static analyses.
  Such a separation of concerns is often obtained via a reduced product on a
  case-by-case basis. In this paper, we lift this idea to abstract domains for
  shape analyses, introducing a domain combination operator for memory
  abstractions. As an example, we present <em>simultaneous separating shape
  graphs</em>, a product construction that combines instances of
  separation logic-based shape domains. The key enabler for this
  construction is a static analysis on inductive data structure
  definitions to derive relations between the skeleton and the alternative
  paths. From the engineering standpoint, this construction allows each
  component to reason independently about different aspects of the data
  structure invariant and then separately exchange information via a
  reduction operator. From the usability standpoint, we enable describing
  a data structure invariant in terms of several inductive definitions
  that hold simultaneously.</p>

        <p>We examine the problem of inferring invariants for
        parametrized systems. Parametrized systems are concurrent
        systems consisting of an a priori unbounded number of process
        instances running the same program. Such systems are commonly
        encountered in many situations including device drivers,
        distributed systems, and robotic swarms. In this paper we
        describe a technique that enables leveraging off-the-shelf
        invariant generators designed for sequential programs to infer
        invariants of parametrized systems. The central challenge in
        invariant inference for parametrized systems is that näıvely
        exploding the transition system with all interleavings is not
        just impractical but impossible. In our approach, the key
        enabler is the notion of a reﬂective abstraction that we prove
        has an important correspondence with inductive
        invariants. This correspondence naturally gives rise to an
        iterative invariant generation procedure that alternates
        between computing candidate invariants and creating reﬂective
        abstractions.</p>

  <p>A static analysis design is <em>sufficient</em> if it can
  prove the property of interest with an acceptable number of
  false alarms.  Ultimately, the only way to confirm that an
  analysis design is sufficient is to implement it and run it on
  real-world programs.  If the evaluation shows that the design
  is insufficient, the designer must return to the drawing board
  and repeat the process&emdash;wasting expensive implementation
  effort over and over again.  In this paper, we make the
  observation that there is a minimal range of code needed to
  prove a property of interest under an ideal static analysis;
  we call such a range of code a <em>validation scope</em>.
  Armed with this observation, we create a dynamic measurement
  framework that quantifies validation scopes and thus enables
  designers to rule out insufficient designs at lower cost.  A
  novel attribute of our framework is the ability to model
  aspects of static reasoning using dynamic execution
  measurements.  To evaluate the flexibility of our framework,
  we instantiate it on an example property&emdash;null
  dereference errors&emdash;and measure validation scopes on
  real-world programs. We use a broad range of metrics that
  capture the difficulty of analyzing programs along varying
  dimensions.  We also examine how validation scopes evolve as
  developers fix null dereference errors and as code matures.
  We find that bug fixes shorten validation scopes, that longer
  validation scopes are more likely to be buggy, and that
  overall validation scopes are remarkably stable as programs
  evolve.</p>

        <p>Abstraction refinement is an effective verification
        technique for automatically proving safety properties of
        software. Application of this technique in shape analyses has proved
        impractical as core components of existing refinement techniques such
        as backward analysis, general conjunction, and identification of
        unreachable but doomed states are computationally infeasible in such
        domains.</p>
        <p>We propose a new method to diagnose proof failures to
        be used in a refinement scheme for Separation Logic–based shape
        analyses. To check feasibility of abstract error traces, we perform
        Bounded Model Checking over the traces using a novel encoding into
        SMT. A subsequent diagnosis finds discontinuities on infeasible
        traces, and identifies doomed states admitted by the abstraction. To
        construct doomed states, we give a model-finding algorithm for
        “symbolic heap” Separation Logic formulas, employing the execution
        machinery of the feasibility checker to search for concrete
        counter-examples. The diagnosis has been implemented in SLAyer, and we
        present a simple scheme for refining the abstraction of hierarchical
        data structures, and illustrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from
        the SLAyer test suite.</p>

        <p>
          In this paper, we define timed relational abstractions for
          verifying sampled data control systems. Sampled data control
          systems consist of a plant, modeled as a hybrid system and a
          synchronous controller, modeled as a discrete transition
          system. The controller computes control inputs and/or sends
          control events to the plant based on the periodically
          sampled state of the plant. The correctness of the system
          depends on the controller design as well as an appropriate
          choice of the controller sampling period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach constructs a timed relational abstraction of
          the hybrid plant by replacing the continuous plant dynamics
          by relations. These relations map a state of the plant to
          states reachable within the sampling time period. We present
          techniques for building timed relational abstractions, while
          taking care of discrete transitions that can be taken by the
          plant between samples. The resulting abstractions are better
          suited for the verification of sampled data control
          systems. The abstractions focus on the states that can be
          observed by the controller at the sample times, while
          abstracting away behaviors between sample times
          conservatively. The resulting abstractions are discrete,
          infinite-state transition systems. Thus conventional
          verification tools can be used to verify safety properties
          of these abstractions. We use k-induction to prove safety
          properties and bounded model checking (BMC) to find
          potential falsifications. We present our idea, its
          implementation and results on many benchmark examples.

        <p>A SAT-based incremental, inductive algorithm for model
        checking CTL properties is proposed. As in classic CTL model
        checking, the parse graph of the property shapes the
        analysis. However, in the proposed algorithm, called IICTL,
        the analysis is directed by task states that are pushed down
        the parse tree. To each node is associated over- and
        under-approximations to the set of states satisfying that
        node’s property; these approximations are refined until a
        proof that the property does or does not hold is
        obtained. Each CTL operator corresponds naturally to an
        incremental sub-query: given a task state, an EX node executes
        a SAT query; an EU node applies IC3; and an EG node applies
        FAIR. In each case, the query result provides more general
        information than necessary to satisfy the task. When a query
        is satisfiable, the returned trace is generalized using
        forall-exists reasoning, during which IC3 is applied to obtain
        new reachability information that enables greater
        generalization. When a query is unsatisfiable, the proof
        provides the generalization. In this way, property-directed
        abstraction is achieved.

      <abstract>
  <p>An incremental algorithm for model checking progress
  properties is proposed. It follows from the following insight:
  any SCC-closed region of a system’s state graph can be
  represented by a sequence of inductive assertions. Each
  iteration of the algorithm selects a set of states, called a
  skeleton, that together satisfy all fairness conditions; it
  then applies safety model checkers to attempt to connect the
  states into a reachable fair cycle. If this attempt fails, the
  resulting learned lemma takes one of two forms: an inductive
  reachability assertion that shows that at least one state of
  the skeleton is unreachable, or an inductive wall that deﬁnes
  two SCC-closed regions of the state graph. Subsequent
  skeletons must be chosen entirely from one side of the
  wall. Because a lemma often applies more generally than to the
  one skeleton from which it was derived, property-directed
  abstraction is achieved. The algorithm is highly
  parallelizable.</p>

  <p>We present techniques for determining the precision gap
  between Andersen's points-to analysis and precise
  flow-insensitive points-to analysis in practice.  While
  previous work has shown that such a gap may exist, no
  efficient algorithm for precise flow-insensitive analysis is
  known, making measurement of the gap on real-world programs
  difficult.  We give an algorithm for precise flow-insensitive
  analysis of programs with finite memory, based on a novel
  technique for refining any points-to analysis with a search
  for flow-insensitive witnesses.  We give a compact symbolic
  encoding of the technique that enables computing the search
  using a tuned SAT solver.  We also present extensions of the
  algorithm that enable computing lower and upper bounds on the
  precision gap in the presence of dynamic memory allocation. In
  our experimental evaluation over a suite of small- to
  medium-sized C programs, we never observed a precision gap
  between Andersen's analysis and the precise analysis. In other
  words, Andersen's analysis computed a precise flow-insensitive
  result for all of our benchmarks.  Hence, we conclude that
  while better algorithms for the precise flow-insensitive
  analysis are still of theoretical interest, their practical
  impact for C programs is likely to be negligible.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p> In this paper, we define relational abstractions of hybrid systems.
  A relational abstraction is obtained by replacing the continuous
  dynamics in each mode by a binary transition relation that relates a
  state of the system to any state that can potentially be reached at
  some future time instant using the continuous dynamics.  We
  construct relational abstractions by reusing template-based
  invariant generation techniques for continuous systems described by
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).  As a result, we abstract a
  given hybrid system as a purely discrete, infinite-state system.  We
  apply k-induction to this abstraction to prove safety properties,
  and use bounded model-checking to find potential falsifications.  We
  present the basic underpinnings of our approach and demonstrate its
  use on many benchmark systems to derive simple and usable
  abstractions. </p>

 <p>      We present abstraction techniques that transform a given non-linear
  dynamical system into a linear system, such that, invariant
  properties of the resulting linear abstraction can be used to infer
  invariants for the original system. The abstraction techniques rely
  on a change of bases transformation that associates each state
  variable of the abstract system with a function involving the state
  variables of the original system. We present conditions under which
  a given change of basis transformation for a non-linear system can
  define an abstraction. </p>

<p>  Furthermore, we present a technique to discover, given a non-linear
  system, if a change of bases transformation involving degree-bounded
  polynomials yielding a linear system abstraction exists. If so, our
  technique yields the resulting abstract linear system, as well. This
  approach is further extended to search for a change of bases
  transformation that abstracts a given non-linear system into a
  system of linear differential inclusions.  Our techniques enable the
  use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer invariants
  for non-linear systems. We present preliminary evidence of the
  practical feasibility of our ideas using a prototype implementation. </p>

<p>S-TaLiRo is a Matlab (TM) toolbox that searches for trajectories of
minimal robustness in Simulink/Stateflow diagrams. It can analyze
arbitrary Simulink models or user defined functions that model the
system. At the heart of the tool, we use randomized testing based on
stochastic optimization techniques including Monte-Carlo methods and
Ant-Colony Optimization. Among the advantages of the toolbox is the
seamless integration inside the Matlab environment, which is widely
used in the industry for model-based development of control
software. We present the architecture of S-TaLiRo and its working on

  <p>Template polyhedra generalize weakly relational domains by
  specifying arbitrary fixed linear expressions on the left-hand sides
  of inequalities and undetermined constants on the right. The domain
  operations required for analysis over template polyhedra can be
  computed in polynomial time using linear programming.  In this
  paper, we introduce the generalized template polyhedral domain that
  extends template polyhedra using fixed left-hand side expressions
  with bilinear forms involving program variables and unknown
  parameters to the right. We prove that the domain operations over
  generalized templates can be defined as the ``best possible
  abstractions'' of the corresponding polyhedral domain
  operations. The resulting analysis can straddle the entire space of
  linear relation analysis starting from the template domain to the
  full polyhedral domain.</p>


<p>  We show that analysis in the generalized template domain can be
  performed by dualizing the join, post-condition and widening
  operations.  We also investigate the special case of template
  polyhedra wherein each bilinear form has at most two parameters. For
  this domain, we use the special properties of two dimensional
  polyhedra and techniques from fractional linear programming to
  derive domain operations that can be implemented in polynomial time
  over the number of variables in the program and the size of the
  polyhedra. We present applications of generalized template polyhedra
  to strengthen previously obtained invariants by converting them into
  templates.  We describe an experimental evaluation of an
  implementation over several benchmark systems.</p>

  <p>Several programming languages are beginning to integrate
  static and dynamic typing, including Racket (formerly PLT
  Scheme), Perl 6, and C# 4.0 and the research languages Sage
  (Gronski, Knowles, Tomb, Freund, and Flanagan, 2006) and Thorn
  (Wrigstad, Eugster, Field, Nystrom, and Vitek, 2009). However,
  an important open question remains, which is how to add
  parametric polymorphism to languages that combine static and
  dynamic typing. We present a system that permits a value of
  dynamic type to be cast to a polymorphic type and vice versa,
  with relational parametricity enforced by a kind of dynamic
  sealing along the lines proposed by Matthews and Ahmed (2008)
  and Neis, Dreyer, and Rossberg (2009). Our system includes a
  notion of blame, which allows us to show that when casting
  between a more-precise type and a less-precise type, any cast
  failures are due to the less-precisely-typed portion of the
  program. We also show that a cast from a subtype to its
  supertype cannot fail.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>Interprocedural program analysis is often performed by
  computing procedure summaries.  While possible, computing
  adequate summaries is difficult, particularly in the presence
  of recursive procedures.  In this paper, we propose a
  complementary framework for interprocedural analysis based on
  a direct abstraction of the calling context.  Specifically,
  our approach exploits the inductive structure of a calling
  context by treating it directly as a stack of activation
  records.  We then build an abstraction based on separation
  logic with inductive definitions.  A key element of this
  abstract domain is the use of parameters to refine the meaning
  of such call stack summaries and thus express relations across
  activation records and with the heap.  In essence, we define
  an abstract interpretation-based analysis framework for
  recursive programs that permits a fluid per call site
  abstraction of the call stack&emdash;much like how shape analyzers
  enable a fluid per program point abstraction of the heap.</p>

  <p>Electronic, software-managed mechanisms using, for example,
  radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards, enable great
  flexibility in specifying access control policies to physical
  spaces.  For example, access rights may vary based on time of
  day or could differ in normal versus emergency situations.
  With such fine-grained control, understanding and reasoning
  about what a policy permits becomes surprisingly difficult
  requiring knowledge of permission levels, spatial layout, and
  time.  In this paper, we present a formal modeling framework,
  called <fmt kind="tool">Access Nets</fmt>, suitable for describing a
  combination of access permissions, physical spaces, and
  temporal constraints.  Furthermore, we provide evidence that
  model checking techniques are effective in reasoning about
  physical access control policies.  We describe our results
  from a tool that uses reachability analysis to validate
  security policies.</p>

  <p>Static analysis designers must carefully balance precision
  and efficiency.  In our experience, many static analysis tools
  are built around an elegant, core algorithm, but that
  algorithm is then extensively tweaked to add just enough
  precision for the coding idioms seen in practice, without
  sacrificing too much efficiency.  There are several downsides
  to adding precision in this way: the tool's implementation
  becomes much more complicated; it can be hard for an end-user
  to interpret the tool's results; and as software systems vary
  tremendously in their coding styles, it may require
  significant algorithmic engineering to enhance a tool to
  perform well in a particular software domain.</p>
  <p>In this paper, we present Mix, a novel system that mixes
  type checking and symbolic execution.  The key aspect of our
  approach is that these analyses are applied independently on
  disjoint parts of the program, in an off-the-shelf manner.  At
  the boundaries between nested type checked and symbolically
  executed code regions, we use special mix rules to communicate
  information between the off-the-shelf systems.  The resulting
  mixture is a provably sound analysis that is more precise than
  type checking alone and more efficient than exclusive symbolic
  execution.  In addition, we also describe a prototype
  implementation, <fmt kind="tool">Mixy</fmt>, for C.  Mixy
  checks for potential null dereferences by mixing a
  null/non-null type qualifier inference system with a symbolic
  executor.</p>

    Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods
    that are worth optimizing: the "hot" methods. This paper
    shows that four commonly-used Java profilers (xprof, hprof,
    jprofile, and yourkit) often disagree on the identity of the
    hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be
    incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will
    mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a
    cold method with little or no performance improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and
    to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It
    shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental
    requirement for sampling-based profilers: to be correct, a
    sampling-based profiler must collect samples randomly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects
    samples randomly, does not suffer from the above
    problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case
    studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that
    are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers
    report that these methods are cold and thus not worth
    optimizing.

  <p>The blame calculus of Wadler and Findler gives a high-level
  semantics to casts in higher-order languages. The coercion
  calculus of Henglein, on the other hand, provides an
  instruction set for casts whose normal forms ensure space
  efficiency. In this paper we address two questions: 1) can
  space efficiency be obtained in a high-level semantics? and 2)
  can we precisely characterize the relationship between the
  high and low-level semantics of casts? Towards answering both
  of these questions, we design a cast calculus that summarizes
  a sequence of casts as a threesome cast that contains a source
  type, a target type, and a third middle type that is the
  greatest lower bound of all the types in the sequence. We show
  that the threesome calculus is equivalent to the blame
  calculus and to one of the coercion-based, blame-tracking
  calculi of Siek, Garcia, and Taha. We also show that the
  threesome calculus is space efficient and obtain a tighter
  bound than that of Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan.</p>

      <abstract>
  <p>To improve the performance of transactional memory (TM),
  researchers have found many eager and lazy optimizations for
  conflict detection, the process of determining if transactions
  can commit. Despite these optimizations, nearly all TMs
  perform one aspect of lazy conflict detection in the same
  manner to preserve serializability. That is, they perform
  commit-time validation, where a transaction is checked for
  conflicts with previously committed transactions during its
  commit phase. While commit-time validation is efficient for
  workloads that exhibit limited contention, it can limit
  transaction throughput for contending workloads.

        This paper presents an efficient implementation of commit-time
        invalidation, a strategy where transactions resolve their
        conflicts with in-flight (uncommitted) transactions before
        they commit. Commit-time invalidation supplies the contention
        manager (CM) with data that is unavailable through commit-time
        validation, allowing the CM to make decisions that increase
        transaction throughput. Commit-time invalidation also requires
        notably fewer operations than commit-time validation for
        memory-intensive transactions, uses zero commit-time
        operations for dynamically detected read-only transactions,
        and guarantees full opacity for any transaction in O(N) time,
        an improvement over incremental validation's O(N2) time. Our
        experimental results show that for contending workloads, our
        efficient commit-time invalidating software TM (STM) is up to
        3 x faster than TL2, a state-of-the-art validating STM.</p>

  <p>Detailed memory models that expose individual fields are
  necessary to precisely analyze code that makes use of
  low-level aspects such as, pointers to fields and untagged
  unions.  Yet, higher-level representations that collect fields
  into records are often used because they are typically more
  convenient and efficient in modeling the program heap.  In
  this paper, we present a shape graph representation of memory
  that exposes individual fields while largely retaining the
  convenience of an object-level model.  This representation has
  a close connection to particular kinds of formulas in
  separation logic.  Then, with this representation, we show how
  to extend the <fmt kind="tool">Xisa</fmt> shape analyzer for
  low-level aspects, including pointers to fields, C-style
  nested structures and unions, malloc and free, and array
  values, with minimal changes to the core algorithms (e.g.,
  materialization and summarization).</p>

  <p>Memory bandwidth limits the performance of important
  kernels in many scientific applications. Such applications
  often use sequences of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
  (BLAS), and highly efficient implementations of those routines
  enable scientists to achieve high performance at little
  cost. However, tuning the BLAS in isolation misses
  opportunities for memory optimization that result from
  composing multiple subprograms. Because it is not practical to
  create a library of all BLAS combinations, we have developed a
  domain-specific compiler that generates them on demand. In
  this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for compiling linear
  algebra kernels and searching for the best combination of
  optimization choices. We also present a new hybrid
  analytic/empirical method for quickly evaluating the
  profitability of each optimization. We report experimental
  results showing speedups of up to 130% relative to the
  GotoBLAS on an AMD Opteron and up to 137% relative to MKL on
  an Intel Core 2.</p>
