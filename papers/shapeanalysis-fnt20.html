            <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="">The computation of semantic information about the behavior of pointer-manipulating programs has been a long standing issue,
               attacked with diverse and numerous techniques and tools for over 50 years. As usual in automatic verification of infinite-state
               programs, properties of interest are not computable. Thus, static analyses can only be conservative, leading different analyses
               to make different tradeoffs between the intricacies of the properties they detect, the precision of their inference procedure
               and analysis, and the scalability of the analysis.
            </p>
            
            
            <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="">In this context, shape analyses focus on inferring highly complex properties of heap-manipulating programs. These programs
               utilize data structures which are implemented using an unbounded number of dynamically- (heap-) allocated memory cells interconnected
               via mutable pointer-links. Because shape analyses have to reason about data structures whose size is not bounded by a fixed,
               known value, they cannot track explicitly the particular properties of every concrete memory cell which the program uses,
               as done, e.g., by analysis of variable-manipulating non-recursive programs. Instead, shape analyses summarize memory regions
               by letting one piece of abstract information, called summary predicate, describe several concrete cells. The need to cope
               with data structures of unbounded sizes is a challenge shape analyses share with static analyzers of array-manipulating programs.
               However, while the size of an array may change in different executions, its layout (i.e., its dimensions and the way its contents
               are spread over the memory) is fixed. In contrast, the layout of a pointer-linked data structure, colloquially referred to
               as its shape, may evolve dynamically during the program execution and a memory cell can be part of different data structures
               at different points in time. As a result, shape analyses need to let the denotation of summary predicates in terms of the
               constituents and layouts of the memory regions which they represent evolve during the analysis as well.
            </p>
            
            
            <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="">In this survey, we consider that shape analyses are characterized and defined by the presence of summary predicates describing
               a set of concrete memory cells that varies during the course of the analysis. We use this characterization as a means for
               distinguishing shape analyses as a particular class of pointer analyses. We show that many “standard” pointer analyses do
               not fit the aforementioned description, while many analyses relying on very different mathematical foundations, e.g., shape
               graphs, three-valued logic, and separation logic, do.
            </p>
            
            
            <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="">The ambition of this survey is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of shape analysis, and to present the
               foundation of this topic, in a single document that is accessible to readers who are not familiar with it. To do so, we characterize
               the essence of shape analysis compared to more classical pointer analyses. We supply the intuition underlying the abstractions
               commonly used in shape analysis and the algorithms that allow to statically compute intricate semantic properties. Then, we
               cover the main families of shape analysis abstraction and algorithms, highlight the similarities between them, and also characterize
               the main differences between the most common approaches. Last, we review a few other static analysis works (such as array
               abstractions, dictionary abstractions and interprocedural analyses) that were influenced by the ideas of shape analysis, so
               as to demonstrate the impact of the field.
