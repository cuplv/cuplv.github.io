The Programming Languages and Verification Group at the University of Colorado Boulder (CUPLV) is looking for candidates for a full-time research software engineer position that lasts until <TODO>.

The research software engineer will work on a technology transfer task collaborating with professors Evan Chang (evan.chang@colorado.edu), Sriram Sankaranarayanan (srirams@colorado.edu), and Sergio Mover (sergio.mover@polytechnique.edu), and engineers from GitHub (github.com).

The technology transfer project consists of re-engineering and extending the research prototype of BigGroum (https://github.com/cuplv/biggroum). BigGroum is a platform that mines software repositories to learn how to use API libraries, and then learned artifacts to help software developers, for example automatically suggesting code fixes.
The final deliverable of the project is a new prototype of the tool that scale on large software repositories, is robust and extensible, and has more functionalities (e.g., supports the mining of software repositories containing multiple programming languages).


The position is available immediately and will last until the <TODO>.

We are looking for a motivated software engineer that is excited to learn and understand new algorithms and techniques, and further extend them be usable in a real, industrial setting. 
The engineer will mainly work under the supervision of the CUPLV team at the University of Colorado Boulder and will frequently collaborate with GitHub's engineers.


Responsibilities:
  - Design the architecture of the new prototype, considering the new features and non-functional requirements (scalability, extensibility, robustness)
  - Implement the prototype following best practices in software engineering (e.g., unit and integration testing, collaborative software development, ...)
  - Plan the design and development activities, respect the planned deadlines, and periodically update on the current progress.


Minimum qualifications:
  - B.Sc. in computer science or equivalent
  - Knowledge of the Java, Scala, C++, and Python (Scala or Java are compulsory, knowing the other languages is a plus)
  - Experience in designing and implementing medium size or large size software systems
  - Can plan its own activity and work independently to achieve a task
  - Motivated and committed to achieve the project's goals


Additional qualifications:
  - Experience in working in an academic environment
  - Knowledge (theoretical or practical) of programming language analysis or compiler
  - Knowledge of machine learning and/or data mining
