# cuplv.github.io
## How to edit this website:
 * Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:cuplv/cuplv.github.io.git`
 * initialize CVX submodule: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
 * Make changes to `pl.xml` only -- **do not directly edit `.html` files**, as those will be autogenerated from the XML, overwriting your changes.  In particular, you probably want to:
     * *Add or change your personal information:* Edit the `people` table to add a `person` entry for yourself or a co-author, make changes to your website URL, or type (e.g. Masters, PhD, Alumni). To add or change a headshot, also commit an image to the `./pics` directory, changing or adding the path in the `people -> person -> face` field of `pl.xml`.
     * *Add a publication:* Commit a PDF of the paper to the `./papers` directory.  Edit the `publications` table, adding `pub` entry with the requisite metadata.  If this is the first/only paper from a given venue, you will also need to add that venue to the `events` table.
	 * *Add a news item or talk announcement:* Add a `news` item to the `news-list` table, including a short one-line-ish `news-snippet` and few-sentences-ish `news-detail`.  You can reference other tables (e.g. `pub`, `person`, `event`) with `ref` tags.
 * `make`
 * `open index.html` and verify that all of your changes look as expected. (and nothing else looks egregiously broken)
 * `git add` *all* changed files: `pl.xml`, any added assets, and all generated HTML.
 * `git commit` your changes (with a good commit message!) and `git push origin HEAD` them up to Github.
 * Your changes will be visible at `plv.colorado.edu` within a few minutes!
